In previous chapters, we used single variables (like `int score` or `String name`) to hold data. This works well for individual pieces of information. However, complex programs often require managing large collections of related data, such as a list of 100 test scores or the names of 50 students. To handle these data structures efficiently, Java introduces the concept of **arrays**.

Arrays allow us to organize numerous data elements under a single variable name, enabling powerful processing capabilities, often utilizing loops (which you mastered in Chapter 4).

## What you will learn

In this chapter, you will learn how to:

- Understand that arrays are **objects** that store a **fixed-size sequence of elements** of the same data type.
- Declare, create, and initialize arrays using default or custom values.
- Access and manipulate array elements using **subscripts** and understand **zero-based indexing**.
- Process array elements efficiently using `for` loops and the **enhanced `for` loop**.
- Understand the importance of **array bounds checking** and the `length` field.
- Pass arrays to methods and understand Java’s **pass-by-reference** mechanism for objects.
- Work with arrays of objects, including `String` arrays and custom classes.
- Implement multi-dimensional structures using **two-dimensional arrays**.
- Understand the concept of **command-line arguments** passed to the `main` method.
