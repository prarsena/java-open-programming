# 7.4 String Arrays and Arrays of Objects

Arrays can store references to Java objects, including the special `String` class and custom objects you create (Chapter 6).

## String Arrays

A String array holds references to multiple `String` objects. Since each element of a String array is itself a `String` object, you can call any `String` method directly on that element using dot notation.

**Example: Preparing an Artist List for Sorting**

This example demonstrates how to iterate through a **String array**, use methods like `startsWith()` and `substring()` to clean the data (removing "The " for better sorting):

```java
public class ArtistList {
    void main() {
        // Initial list of artists
        String[] artists = {
            "Steely Dan", "The Clash", "The Misfits", "David Bowie",
            "The Smiths", "The Cure", "Jimi Hendrix", "New Order",
            "The Velvet Underground", "Queen", "Cocteau Twins"
        };

        IO.println("--- Original List ---");
        for (String name : artists) {
            IO.println(name);
        }
        
        IO.println("\n--- Data Cleanup: Removing 'The ' ---");
        
        // Use a standard loop to process and clean up the data
        for (int i = 0; i < artists.length; i++) {
            String currentArtist = artists[i];
            // Check if the current artist name starts with "The " (case sensitive)
            if (currentArtist.startsWith("The ")) {
                
                // Get the substring starting at index 4 (right after "The ")
                String cleanedName = currentArtist.substring(4);
                
                // Reassign the array element with the cleaned string
                artists[i] = cleanedName;
                
                IO.println("Changed: " + currentArtist + " -> " + cleanedName);
            }
        }
        
        IO.println("\n--- Updated List ---"); 
        for (String name : artists) { 
            IO.println(name); 
        }
    }
}
```

## Arrays of Custom Objects

Arrays can also store references to custom objects, such as `Car` or `Song` objects. When you create an array of objects, you are only reserving space for the *references* (memory addresses); you must individually initialize each object within the array.

**Example: The Car Lot Simulation**

If we assume a fully coded `Car` class exists with a setter method `setAvailable(boolean status)`, we can create an array of `Car` objects:

public class CarLot {
    void main() {
        // 1. Create an array reference to hold 5 Car objects (size 5)
        Car[] cars = new Car[5]; 

        // 2. Instantiate each Car object individually (required for objects!)
        cars[0] = new Car("Mustang", 2023);
        cars[1] = new Car("Civic", 2024);
        cars[2] = new Car("Model 3", 2022);
        cars[3] = new Car("F-150", 2021);
        cars[4] = new Car("Focus", 2023);

        // 3. Use an instance method on an element to modify its state
        // The index for the 4th car is 3 (index 0, 1, 2, 3)
        cars[3].setAvailable(false); // Mark the F-150 as sold

        // 4. Check the status of the 4th car (index 3)
        if (!cars[3].isAvailable()) {
            IO.println("Car at index 3 (F-150) is marked unavailable.");
        }
    if (!cars[3].isAvailable()) {
        IO.println("Car at index 3 (F-150) is marked unavailable.");
    }
}
```

#### Check Your Understanding (7.4)

1. If `String[] words = {"alpha", "beta", "gamma"};`, what is the index of the element containing the string "beta"? Write the code to convert that element to all uppercase letters.
2. When you declare an array of custom objects, such as `Song[] playlist = new Song;`, why do you still need to use the `new` keyword ten times inside a loop or individually to fully initialize the array elements?

#### Practice Problems (7.4)

1.  **Object Access:** Assume a `User` class has a public instance method `getUsername()`. Write the correct code snippet to retrieve and print the username of the user stored at index 0 of an array named `userList`.

```java
User[] userList = new User[10];
userList[0] = new User("Neo");
// Write the print statement here
```

2.  **String Method Check:** Given `String[] fruit = {"apple", "Banana", "Cherry"};`, write an `if` statement that checks if the string at index 1 is equal to "banana", ignoring case differences.
