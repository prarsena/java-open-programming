# 7.7 Command-Line Arguments

After enduring months of instruction, you are now ready to learn the secret meaning of the method header that begins every Java executable class: `public static void main(String[] args)`.

The `String[] args` parameter means that the `main` method is configured to receive an array of `String` objects, referred to as `args`. These are the **command-line arguments** passed to your program when it is executed outside of an IDE.

This allows users to provide input to the program immediately upon execution.

You access these arguments positionally, just like any other array, using the index: `args`, `args`, etc..

**Warning:** If a user runs your program without providing the expected arguments, attempting to access a missing index (e.g., `args` when no arguments were provided) will result in an **`ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`**.

**Example: The Program Launcher**

If you compile and run the following program from the command line:

```java
public class ProgramLauncher {
    // The main method expects an array of strings called args
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Check if at least one argument was provided
        if (args.length > 0) {
            String name = args[0]; // Access the first argument
            
            // Access the length of the args array field
            System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!"); 
            System.out.println("You supplied " + args.length + " command line arguments.");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Please run this program with your name as an argument.");
            System.out.println("Example: java ProgramLauncher Sarah");
        }
    }
}
```

**Running the Program (Command Line):**

| Command | Output |
| :--- | :--- |
| `java ProgramLauncher Max` | Hello, Max! You supplied 1 command line arguments. |
| `java ProgramLauncher Data File 2024` | Hello, Data!` You supplied 3 command line arguments. |

# Check Your Understanding (7.7)

1. What does the `String[] args` portion of the `main` method header represent?
2. If a user executes a program but provides no command-line arguments, what value is stored in `args.length`?

# Practice Problems (7.7)

1. **Conversion:** If a user passes the string "50" as the first command-line argument, write the code snippet required to convert this string argument into an integer variable named `startValue`.
2. **Access:** Write a check that ensures at least three command-line arguments have been provided before attempting to access `args`.
