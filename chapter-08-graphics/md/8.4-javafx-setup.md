# Setting Up JavaFX with Build Tools

Unlike Swing, **JavaFX is not included in the standard JDK** (since Java 11). This means you cannot just `import javafx.*` and run your code; you must download the JavaFX library and tell your Java environment where to find it.

While you can manually download the SDK and configure your classpath (as shown in the "Manual Setup" section below), the professional way to manage dependencies in Java is using a **Build Tool**.

## What is a Build Tool?

A build tool automates the process of compiling your code, managing libraries (dependencies), and packaging your application. The two most popular build tools in the Java ecosystem are **Maven** and **Gradle**.

Instead of downloading `.jar` files and manually adding them to your project, you simply list the libraries you need in a configuration file. The build tool downloads them from a central repository (like Maven Central) and ensures they are available to your program.

## Option 1: Using Maven

Maven uses an XML file called `pom.xml` (Project Object Model) to describe your project.

### 1. Create a Maven Project
In VS Code, you can create a new Maven project using the "Create Java Project" command and selecting "Maven".

### 2. The `pom.xml` File
To use JavaFX, you add the dependencies to your `pom.xml`.

```xml
<dependencies>
    <!-- JavaFX Controls -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
        <artifactId>javafx-controls</artifactId>
        <version>21</version>
    </dependency>
    <!-- JavaFX FXML (if using FXML layouts) -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
        <artifactId>javafx-fxml</artifactId>
        <version>21</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

### 3. The JavaFX Plugin
To run your application easily, you should also add the JavaFX Maven Plugin.

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
            <artifactId>javafx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.0.8</version>
            <configuration>
                <mainClass>com.example.App</mainClass>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

Now, you can run your app from the terminal with:
`mvn javafx:run`

## Option 2: Using Gradle

Gradle is a newer build tool that uses a Groovy or Kotlin-based DSL (Domain Specific Language) instead of XML. It is often considered more flexible and faster than Maven.

### 1. The `build.gradle` File
In your `build.gradle` file, you apply the JavaFX plugin and specify the version.

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'application'
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.0.13'
}

javafx {
    version = "21"
    modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml' ]
}

application {
    mainClass = 'com.example.App'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}
```

Now, you can run your app with:
`./gradlew run`

## Option 3: Manual Setup (The Hard Way)

If you are writing a simple script and don't want to set up a full Maven/Gradle project, you can still do it manually.

### 1. Download the JavaFX SDK

1.  Go to the [Gluon JavaFX download page](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
2.  Download the **SDK** for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3.  Extract the downloaded zip file to a permanent location on your computer (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-21` or `/Users/Shared/Java/javafx-sdk-21`).

### 2. Configuring VS Code

If you are using Visual Studio Code with the Java Extension Pack:

1.  Open the **Java Projects** view in the Side Bar.
2.  Find your project and look for **Referenced Libraries**.
3.  Click the **+** icon.
4.  Navigate to the `lib` folder inside your downloaded JavaFX SDK.
5.  Select all the `.jar` files (e.g., `javafx.base.jar`, `javafx.controls.jar`, etc.) and click **Select Jar Libraries**.

### 3. Running from Command Line

When running manually, you must specify the **Module Path**.

```bash
java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk-21/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml MyJavaFXApp.java
```

*   `--module-path`: Points to the `lib` folder of the SDK.
*   `--add-modules`: Lists the JavaFX modules your app needs.

## Summary

*   **Maven/Gradle**: Best for real projects. Handles downloads and classpath automatically.
*   **Manual**: Good for quick experiments, but requires manual configuration every time.

For this course, we recommend trying to set up a **Maven** project, as it is the industry standard for Java dependency management.
