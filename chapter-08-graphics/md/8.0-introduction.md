# Introduction to Graphics and Web

Java has a rich history of libraries for creating Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and working with graphics. From the original Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) to the robust Swing library, and finally to the modern JavaFX platform, Java provides multiple ways to interact with users beyond the command line.

In this chapter, we will explore the evolution of these tools. We will start with the basics of image manipulation with AWT, move to building windows with Swing, and conclude with the modern JavaFX platform and web architectures.

## A Brief History of Java GUIs

To understand why there are so many ways to build a window in Java, it helps to know the history.

### 1. AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) - 1995
When Java 1.0 was released, it included AWT. AWT used the operating system's native components ("peers") to draw buttons and windows.
*   **Pros**: Looked exactly like the native OS.
*   **Cons**: "Write Once, Run Anywhere" was hard because different OSs behaved differently. It was "heavyweight" and limited to the lowest common denominator of features.

### 2. Swing (JFC) - 1998
Swing was built on top of AWT but rendered components itself using Java code. These were called "lightweight" components.
*   **Pros**: Consistent look and feel across all platforms. Much richer set of components (Tables, Trees, Tabbed Panes).
*   **Cons**: Could be slower than native apps. The default look ("Metal") was often criticized.
*   **Status**: Still widely used in enterprise legacy apps and simple tools (like the ones we build in class).

### 3. JavaFX - 2008
JavaFX was designed to replace Swing. It uses hardware acceleration (GPU) for modern graphics, supports CSS for styling, and FXML for layout.
*   **Pros**: Modern look, 3D support, animation support, separates design from logic.
*   **Cons**: Not included in the JDK by default anymore (requires separate download/setup).
*   **Status**: The recommended choice for new desktop applications.

### 4. The Web Era (Spring Boot) - Present
Today, many developers use Java for the backend (server) and build the frontend using Web technologies (HTML/JavaScript/React). However, for desktop tools, scientific applications, and internal enterprise software, JavaFX and Swing remain powerful choices.
