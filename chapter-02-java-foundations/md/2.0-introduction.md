Let's move on to the foundational concepts of the Java programming language. In this chapter, we'll explore into the basic building blocks of Java programs, including how to structure your code, display output, understand different types of data, and perform operations.

## What you will learn
In this chapter, you will learn how to:

- Describe the difference between the Java Programming Language and the Java Platform.
- Write and run your first Java program.
- Work with variables and data types.
- Use operators and expressions.
- Handle input and output.
- Use constants and wrapper classes.
- Explore the Java API and Math class.
- Practice writing Java with JShell.

So let's spill the beans on Java: What is it? Where did it come from? Is it still relevant?! 

## A Note on Java 25 and the "Modern" Syntax
This book uses **Java 25**, which introduces significant improvements to make the language more beginner-friendly and concise. If you have seen Java code before, or if you look at older tutorials online, you might see "verbose" code that requires a lot of boilerplate just to print "Hello, World!".

Java 25 introduces the `IO` class and "implicitly declared classes" to strip away that complexity.

*   **The "Classic" Way:** Requires understanding `public class`, `static void main`, `String[] args`, and `System.out.println` before writing a single line of logic.
*   **The "Modern" Way:** Allows you to write code directly, using `IO.println()` and `IO.readln()` for input and output.

I believe it is important to use these new features because they allow you to focus on **logic** and **problem-solving** first, rather than syntax. However, we will also show you the "Classic" way throughout this book so you can understand the history and read legacy code.

For example, here is the difference in reading a name and printing a greeting:

**The "Classic" Way (The "Wall of Concepts"):**

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Greet {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter name: ");
        String name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
    }
}
```

**The "Modern" Way (The "Compact" Style):**

```java
void main() {
    String name = IO.readln("Enter name: ");
    IO.println("Hello, " + name);
}
```

Throughout this book, we will primarily use the Modern style, but we'll provide context for the Classic style where appropriate.

### Other Modern Features
Beyond the structure of the program, modern Java (Java 10+) includes other features that make code cleaner:

*   **`var` keyword:** Instead of repeating type names (e.g., `String name = "Alice"`), you can let the compiler infer the type (`var name = "Alice"`).
*   **Text Blocks:** Instead of using `\n` and `+` to build multi-line strings, you can use triple quotes (`"""`) to write text exactly as it should appear.

We will introduce these features in the relevant sections of this book.
