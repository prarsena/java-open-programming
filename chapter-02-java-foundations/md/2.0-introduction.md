Let's move on to the foundational concepts of the Java programming language. In this chapter, we'll explore into the basic building blocks of Java programs, including how to structure your code, display output, understand different types of data, and perform operations.

## What you will learn
In this chapter, you will learn how to:

- Describe the difference between the Java Programming Language and the Java Platform.
- Write and run your first Java program.
- Work with variables and data types.
- Use operators and expressions.
- Handle input and output.
- Use constants and wrapper classes.
- Explore the Java API and Math class.
- Practice writing Java with JShell.

But first, let's spill the beans on Java—What is it? Where did it come from? Is it still relevant?!
