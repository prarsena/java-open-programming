# 2.3 Operators and Operands 
An **operator** is a symbol or keyword that performs an action on one or more values, while an **operand** is a value that the operator acts upon.

For example, in the expression `2 + 2`:
- `+` is the operator.
- `2` and `2` are the operands.

Java has binary operators (operators that require two operands), unary operator (one operand), and trinary operators (three operands). 

## Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical calculations.

- **Binary Operators**: These operators require two operands (values) to perform an operation.
    - `+` (addition)
    - `-` (subtraction)
    - `*` (multiplication)
    - `/` (division)
    - `%` (modulus - returns the remainder of a division)

```Java
int a = 10;
int b = 3;

System.out.println(a + b); // 13
System.out.println(a - b); // 7
System.out.println(a * b); // 30
System.out.println(a / b); // 3 (Integer division rounds down!)
System.out.println(a % b); // 1 (10 divided by 3 is 3 with a remainder of 1)
```

### Integer Division
Be careful with integer division. When both operands are integers, Java performs integer division, which truncates (rounds down) the result to a whole number, discarding any fractional part.

```Java
int result1 = 7 / 3; // result1 will be 2
double result2 = 7.0 / 3; // result2 will be 2.3333333333333335 (one operand is double)
double result3 = 7 / 3.0; // result3 will be 2.3333333333333335 (one operand is double)
```

### Operator Precedence
Java follows the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):
1. Parentheses `()`
2. Exponents (not a direct operator in Java, typically handled by `Math.pow()`)
3. Multiplication `*`, Division `/`, Modulus `%` (from left to right)
4. Addition `+`, Subtraction `-` (from left to right)

```Java
int calculation = 6 / 2 * (1 + 2);
// 1. (1 + 2) = 3
// 2. 6 / 2 = 3
// 3. 3 * 3 = 9
System.out.println(calculation); // Output: 9
```

### Check Your Understanding: Arithmetic Operators
1. What is an "operand"? Give an example.
2. What is the result of `10 / 4` in Java? Why?
3. Evaluate the following expression step-by-step: `5 + 3 * 2 - 8 / 4`.

## Combined Assignment Operators
These operators combine an arithmetic operation with an assignment. They are frequently used in loops or when accumulating values.

- `+=` (add and assign)
- `-=` (subtract and assign)
- `*=` (multiply and assign)
- `/=` (divide and assign)
- `%=` (modulus and assign)

```Java
int x = 10;
x += 5; // Equivalent to x = x + 5; x is now 15

int y = 20;
y -= 7; // Equivalent to y = y - 7; y is now 13

int z = 5;
z *= 2; // Equivalent to z = z * 2; z is now 10
```

## Check Your Understanding: Combined Operators
1. Rewrite `total = total - amount;` using a combined assignment operator.
2. If `value` is `7`, what is `value` after `value %= 3;` ?

## Conversion between Primitive Data Types
Java allows you to convert values from one primitive data type to another. This is known as "casting."
### Implicit Casting (Widening Conversion)
Implicit casting occurs automatically when you convert a smaller data type to a larger data type. This is safe because there's no risk of losing information. The order of widening conversions is: 
`byte` → `short` → `char` → `int` → `long` → `float` → `double`.

```Java
int num = 100;
double result = num; // Implicitly converts int to double
System.out.println(result); // Output: 100.0
```
### Explicit Casting (Narrowing Conversion)
Explicit casting (or narrowing conversion) is required when converting a larger data type to a smaller data type because there's a risk of losing data or precision. You must manually specify the target type in parentheses before the value you want to convert.

```Java
double decimal = 100.99;
int decCast = (int) decimal; // Explicitly casts double to int
System.out.println(decCast); // Output: 100 (the decimal part is truncated)
```
### Mixed Integer Operations
When an operation involves different integer types, the result is typically promoted to the largest type involved to prevent loss of data.

```Java
byte b = 10;
int i = 5;
int sum = b + i; // byte 'b' is promoted to int before addition
```

### Other Mixed Mathematical Expressions
Similar to mixed integer operations, when a `double` is involved in an arithmetic expression with an `int` or `float`, the result will be a `double`.

```Java
int intVal = 5;
double doubleVal = 2.5;
double mixedResult = intVal * doubleVal; // intVal is promoted to double, result is double
System.out.println(mixedResult); // Output: 12.5
```

### Check Your Understanding: Data Conversions
1. Explain the difference between widening and narrowing conversion.
2. What happens if you cast a `double` value of `15.75` to an `int`?
3. Why is an explicit cast required when converting a `long` to an `int`?

## Extra Exercise (Section 2.3)
1. **Temperature Conversion**: The formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is `F = C * 9/5 + 32`. Write a program that declares a `double` variable for Celsius temperature (e.g., `25.0`), calculates the Fahrenheit equivalent, and prints the result. Be careful with integer division if you use integer literals for `9` and `5`.
2. **Money Calculation**: You have `15.99` dollars and want to calculate how many full dollars you have. Declare a `double` variable for your money and use explicit casting to store the whole dollar amount in an `int` variable. Print both values.
3. **Remainder Practice**: Write a program that takes an integer number of minutes (e.g., `150`) and calculates how many full hours and remaining minutes that represents using integer division and the modulus operator. Print the result (e.g., "150 minutes is 2 hours and 30 minutes").
