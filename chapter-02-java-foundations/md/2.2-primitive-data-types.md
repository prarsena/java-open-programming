# 2.2 Primitive Data Types
Java is a **strongly typed** language. When you create a variable in Java, it must have a data type. 

Java has eight primitive data types. These are the most basic data types and are built directly into the language. They store simple values directly in memory. You can combine primitive data types to make more complex custom objects. 

| Data Type | Description                  | Range / Values                        | Default Value                | Example                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `byte`    | 8-bit integer                | -128 to 127                           | `0`                          | `byte myAge = 35;`                    |
| `short`   | 16-bit integer               | -32,768 to 32,767                     | `0`                          | `short year = 2025;`                  |
| `int`     | 32-bit integer               | Approximately -2 billion to 2 billion | `0`                          | `int population = 150000;`            |
| `long`    | 64-bit integer               | Used for very large whole numbers     | `0L`                         | `long worldPopulation = 8000000000L;` |
| `float`   | 32-bit floating-point number | Single-precision decimal values       | `0.0f`                       | `float pi = 3.14f;`                   |
| `double`  | 64-bit floating-point number | Double-precision decimal values       | `0.0d`                       | `double price = 19.99;`               |
| `boolean` | Logical data type            | Stores `true` or `false`              | `false`                      | `boolean isAdult = true;`             |
| `char`    | 16-bit Unicode character     | Stores a single character             | `\u0000`<br>(null character) | `char initial = 'J';`                 |

Notice how the default value for these primitives is **0**. This is because, in computer science, counting often begins with 0, a convention known as **zero-based numbering**. This is especially true for indexing, such as with strings or arrays, where the first element is at index 0.

We will primarily focus on `int`, `double`, `char`, and `boolean`.

### Integer Data Types
`byte`, `short`, `int`, and `long` are used to store whole numbers. The choice depends on the range of values you need to store. 

`int` is generally the default choice unless you have specific memory or range requirements.

```Java
byte smallNum = 120;
int count = 1000000;
long veryBigNum = 9876543210L; // 'L' suffix indicates a long literal
```

Integer data types cannot contain decimal points.  

### Floating-Point Data Types
`float` and `double` are used to store numbers with decimal points.

- **`double`**: In most cases, you should use `double` because it provides higher precision and is the default type for decimal literals.
  
```Java
double pi = 3.14159;
double scientific = 4.728197e4; // Represents 4.728197 * 10^4, which is 47281.97
```

- **`float`**: Uses half the memory of `double` and can be slightly faster for certain operations, but offers less precision. If you use a `float` literal, you must append `F` or `f`.

```Java
float lessPrecisePi = 3.14F;
```

### The `boolean` Data Type
The `boolean` data type can only hold one of two values: `true` or `false`. It's fundamental for decision-making in programs.

```Java
boolean isJavaFun = true;
boolean hasPermission = false;
```

### The `char` Data Type
The `char` data type stores a single character. Character literals are enclosed in single quotes.

```Java
char grade = 'A'; // Single quote for char
char symbol = '$';
```

Java's `char` type supports Unicode, meaning it can represent characters from almost any language. You can use Unicode escape sequences (e.g., `\u4F60` for '你'), though it's generally recommended to type the character directly if your editor supports it.

`char` also supports hexadecimal values (e.g., `0x6e` for 'n'). Some hexadecimal values have special meanings:
- `0x07` represents the "BEL" character (bell sound).
- `0x20` represents an explicit space character.

### Variable Assignment and Initialization
You can declare a variable and then assign a value to it in separate steps, or you can initialize it (assign a value) at the time of declaration.

```Java
// Declare then assign
int quantity;
quantity = 10;

// Declare and initialize
double temperature = 25.5;
```

Variables in Java _should_ always have a type. However, Java 10 introduced the `var` keyword, which allows the compiler to infer the data type based on the initial value. While convenient, it can sometimes hide the underlying type, potentially leading to compiler errors if you're not careful about the data types involved. It's generally not encouraged for beginners as Java is a **strongly typed language**.

```Java
// Using var (not generally encouraged for beginners)
// var str = "Hello";  // Compiler infers String
// var num = 123;    // Compiler infers int
// var dbl = 45.67;  // Compiler infers double
```

### Variables Hold Only One Value at a Time
A variable can only hold one value of its declared type at any given moment. When you assign a new value to a variable, the old value is overwritten.

```Java
int x = 5;
System.out.println(x); // Output: 5
x = 10;                // The old value (5) is replaced by the new value (10)
System.out.println(x); // Output: 10
```

### Check Your Understanding: Primitives
1. List the four primitive data types we are focusing on in this chapter.
2. When should you use a `double` instead of a `float`?
3. What is the purpose of the `L` suffix on a `long` literal?
4. What character is represented by `\u4F60`?
5. Explain why using the `var` keyword might be discouraged for new Java programmers.

### Extra Exercise (Section 2.2)
1. **Student Profile**: Declare variables for a student's ID number (`long`), their average grade (`double`), whether they are currently enrolled (`boolean`), and their favorite initial character (`char`). Assign appropriate values and print them clearly labeled.
2. **Memory Management**: Imagine you have an `int` variable `count` initialized to `50`. Then you assign `count = 100;`. What is the value of `count` after these operations? Write a small program to verify your answer.
3. **Scientific Notation**: Declare a `double` variable and assign it the value `1.234e-3`. What number does this represent? Print the variable to confirm.
