# 2.1 The Parts of a Java Program 
Here's where the fun really begins! This sections introduces some basic and necessary parts of a Java program, including: 

- **Basic Java program structure**—What's required for a Java program.
- **Print statements**—Writing output to the console to check that your program is running. 
- **Comments**—Write notes to yourself and other programmers in the code that the user never sees.
- **Variables**—Powerful data containers that simplify the management of values in your program.

From here on, I encourage you to follow along in your IDE! Copying the code, running it, changing it, and running it again is an important part of learning to program. 

## Java Program Structure
Every Java program follows a basic structure, often referred to as **boilerplate code**. This provides the necessary framework for your instructions to be executed.

Here's a typical "Hello, World!" program, which is often the first program new developers write. 

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

You may be able to understand some of the code, while other aspects may be unclear. Don't worry about memorizing every part of it now. Here's an explanation of each part:

- **`public class HelloWorld`**: This line declares a class named `HelloWorld`. In Java, all code resides within classes. The `public` keyword means this class is accessible from anywhere. The class name should always start with an uppercase letter and typically matches the filename (e.g., `HelloWorld.java`).
  
- **`public static void main(String[] args)`**: This is the main method, the entry point of every Java application.  
    - `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
    - `static`: This method belongs to the `HelloWorld` class itself, not to a specific instance of the class.
    - `void`: This indicates that the method does not return any value.
    - `main`: This is a special name that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for when starting a program.
    - `String[] args`: This declares a parameter named `args`, which is an array of `String` objects. This allows you to pass command-line arguments to your program, though we won't be using them immediately.
      
- **`System.out.println("Hello, World!");`**: This is the line that actually performs an action – it prints "Hello, World!" to the console. We'll discuss this more in the next section.
  
- **`{ }`**: Curly braces define code blocks. They indicate the start and end of classes, methods, and other control structures.

###### **Check Your Understanding (CYU) Questions**

1. What is the purpose of the `main` method in a Java program?
2. Why does a Java class name typically match its filename?

## Java Compilation to Bytecode with javac
The `HelloWorld.java` program written in the last section is often the first code that Java programmers run because it is a simple, complete Java program. 

To run a Java program, you must first compile it into bytecode (a `.class` file), and then the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can execute the bytecode. When you press the **Run** button on a Java program in an IDE, the IDE automates the two-step process of compiling and executing your code.

This two-step process can be done manually using the `javac` and `java` commands, like so:

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
# Result: a file called HelloWorld.class is generated. 

java HelloWorld
# Result: Executes HelloWorld.class. Outputs the message: 
# Hello, World!
```

The `javac` command is the Java compiler. It takes a `.java` source file and translates the human-readable code into platform-independent bytecode, saving it as a `.class` file. The name of the `.class` file will be the same as the class name in the source file. In this case, `HelloWorld.java` would be compiled into `HelloWorld.class`.

The `java` command is the Java interpreter, which runs the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It takes the **name of the compiled class file** (without the `.class` extension) as an argument and executes its `main` method. The JVM executes the bytecode contained in `HelloWorld.class`.

When you are working with single-file source code programs (as we are currently), you can simply run the Java interpreter command along with a `.java` file name, like so:

```bash
java HelloWorld.java
# Hello, World!
```

Using a single command for both compilation and execution creates a `.class` file in memory or a temporary directory and is usually deleted after execution.


## The `print` and `println` Methods
Java provides simple ways to display output to the console using the `System.out` object.

**`System.out.println()`**: This method prints the specified content to the console and then moves the cursor to the next line.
  
```java
System.out.println("This is the first line.");
System.out.println("This is the second line.");
```

**`Output`:**  
```bash
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
```

**`System.out.print()`**: This method prints the specified content to the console but does _not_ move the cursor to the next line. Subsequent output will appear on the same line.

```Java
System.out.print("This is on the same line. ");
System.out.print("Still on the same line.");
System.out.println(" Now a new line.");
```

**`Output:`**
  
```bash
This is on the same line. Still on the same line. 
Now a new line.
```

Special characters, known as **escape sequences**, can be inserted into a string within a `print()` or `println()` statement in Java. These sequences begin with a backslash `\` followed by a character, allowing you to represent characters that are otherwise difficult or impossible to type directly.

**Common Escape Sequences:**

- `\n`: Newline 
  This moves the cursor to the beginning of the next line, similar to how the println() method works.

```java
System.out.print("First line.\nSecond line.");
```

`Output`:

```Bash
First line.
Second line.
```

- `\t:` Tab 
  This inserts a horizontal tab, useful for aligning text. 

```Java
System.out.println("Name\tAge");
System.out.println("Alice\t30");
```

`Output`:

```bash
Name    Age
Alice   30
```

- `\"`: Double Quote    
  This inserts a literal double quote character " inside a string that is already enclosed in double quotes.

```java
System.out.println("He said, \"Hello, World!\"");
```

`Output`:

```bash
He said, "Hello, World!"
```

- `\'`: Single Quote 
  This inserts a single quote character '. While not strictly necessary inside a double-quoted string (you can just type '), it's a valid escape sequence.

```java
System.out.println("I'm a Java programmer.");
```

`Output`:

```bash
I'm a Java programmer.
```

- `\\`: Backslash   
  This inserts a literal backslash character \, which is required if you want to print a backslash itself.

```java
System.out.println("C:\\Users\\Guest");
```

`Output`:

```bash
C:\Users\Guest
```

By using these escape sequences, you can precisely control the formatting and content of the text you print to the console.

## Check Your Understanding: Print

1. What is the key difference between `System.out.print()` and `System.out.println()`?
2. Write a single `System.out.print()` statement that would produce the output: `HelloThere`.

## Comments
Comments are non-executable lines of code used to explain what the code does. They are crucial for making your code understandable to yourself and other developers. Java supports two main types of comments:

**Single-line comments**: Start with `//`. 

- Everything from `//` to the end of the line is ignored by the compiler.

```java
// This is a single-line comment
System.out.println("Hello"); // This also works
```

**Multi-line comments**: Start with `/*` and `*/`. 

- Everything between these two markers is ignored.
  
```Java
/*
 * This is a multi-line comment.
 * It can span across several lines.
 */
System.out.println("World");
```

## Check Your Understanding: Comments
1. Why are comments important in programming?
2. Which type of comment would you use for a brief explanation of a single line of code?

## Variables and Literals
Variables are named storage locations in a computer's memory that can hold data. Literals are constant values that are directly embedded in the code. 

A **literal** is the raw data itself, while a **variable** is a named container used to store and reference that data. Think of a literal as the content and a variable as the labeled box you put that content into.

See the following code block for an example:

```Java
// Print the String literal "Hello" to the console:
System.out.println("Hello");

// Create a name variable (a container) and put a String into it ("Sarah")
String name = "Sarah";
// Print the contents of the variable 'name' to the console: 
System.out.println(name);
```


Before you can use a variable, you must declare it by specifying its data type and a name.

```Java
int score; // Declaration: declares an integer variable named score
score = 100; // Assignment: assigns the literal value 100 to score

// Declaration and initialization in one line
double price = 19.99;
```


### Displaying Multiple Items with the `+` Operator
The `+` operator in `System.out.print` and `System.out.println` can be used to concatenate (join) strings and other data types for output.

```Java
String name = "Alice";
int age = 30;
System.out.println("Name: " + name + ", Age: " + age);
```

**`Output:`**

```java
Name: Alice, Age: 30
```

### Be Careful with Quotation Marks
String literals are enclosed in double quotation marks (`"`). Characters are enclosed in single quotation marks (`'`). Forgetting or misusing them will lead to compilation errors.

```Java
String greeting = "Hello"; // Correct: double quotes for String
char initial = 'J';      // Correct: single quotes for char

// int number = "123"; // Error: trying to assign a String literal to an int variable
// char letter = "A"; // Error: trying to assign a String literal to a char variable
```

### Identifiers
Identifiers are names given to variables, classes, methods, and other program elements.

- Highly recommended to start with a letter.
- Can start with a dollar sign (`$`) or underscore (`_`), although this is highly discouraged. 
- Cannot start with a digit.
- Cannot contain spaces.
- Can contain letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.
- Are case-sensitive (`myVariable` is different from `myvariable`).
- Cannot be Java keywords (e.g., `public`, `class`, `int`).
### Java Keywords
In Java, a keyword is any one of 68 reserved words that have a predefined meaning in the language. Because of this, you cannot use these words for variables, methods, classes, or as any other identifier.

Examples include keywords that define: 

- **Primitive data types**: `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, `true`, `false`, `null`, `void`.
- **Control flow**: `if`, `else`, `switch`, `case`, `default`, `for`, `while`, `do`, `break`, `continue`, `return`.
- **Class, method, access, and variable modifiers**: `static`, `final`, `abstract`, `synchronized`, `volatile`, `transient`, `public`, `private`, `protected`.
- **Object-oriented programming**: `class`, `extends`, `implements`, `interface`, `new`, `this`, `super`, `instanceof`.
- **Exception handling**: `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`, `assert`. 
- **Modules**: `module`, `exports`, `requires`, `transitive`, `opens`, `to`, `uses`, `provides`, `with`, `sealed`, `permits`.
- **Other**: `goto`, `const`, `enum`, `strictfp`, `record`.

Oracle maintains a list of [Java Language Keywords](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/_keywords.html). 

### Class Names
Class names typically follow **PascalCase** (also known as UpperCamelCase), where the first letter of each word is capitalized (e.g., `MyClass`, `HelloWorld`).

### Check Your Understanding: Variables
1. What is the difference between declaring a variable and initializing it?
2. How would you combine the `String` literal "My name is " with a `String` variable `userName` and an `int` variable `userAge` to print a complete sentence?
3. Which of the following are valid Java identifiers? 
	- `_variable`
	- `1stVar`
	- `my-var`
	- `public`
	- `total$Amount`
	- `my variable`

## Exercises (Section 2.1)
1. **Greeting Program**: Write a Java program that declares two `String` variables, `firstName` and `lastName`, and initializes them with your first and last name. Then, print a greeting message to the console that says "Hello, [firstName] [lastName]!" using `System.out.println()` and the `+` operator.
2. **Product Information**: Declare variables for a product name (`String`), its price (`double`), and the quantity in stock (`int`). Assign appropriate literal values. Print out each piece of information on a new line, clearly labeled (e.g., "Product: [name]").
