## JShell
JShell is an interactive Java console that comes with the Java Development Kit (JDK). It's useful for quickly testing snippets of Java code, experimenting with syntax, declaring variables, and running calculations without needing to create a full Java program file.

To open JShell, simply type `jshell` in your terminal (macOS/Linux) or PowerShell/Command Prompt (Windows). The terminal will display `jshell>` and you can type Java inline, for example:

```java
jshell> int x = 10;
x ==> 10

jshell> x * 2
$2 ==> 20

jshell> String name = "Java";
name ==> "Java"

jshell> name.length()
$4 ==> 4
```

1. What is JShell used for?
2. How do you start JShell from your command line?

#### Practice Problems (2.5)
1. **String to Number Conversion**: Prompt the user to enter their favorite number as text (e.g., "75"). Read this input as a `String`, then convert it to an `int` and print the number multiplied by 2.
2. **Advanced Calculation**: Use `Math` class methods to calculate and print the result of `sqrt(25) + pow(3, 4)`.
3. **JShell Exploration**: Open JShell and try the following:
    - Declare a `double` variable and assign it `123.45`.
    - Calculate the absolute value of `-15` using `Math.abs()`.
    - Convert the `String` "2024" to an `int` using `Integer.parseInt()`.
    - Experiment with `IO.print()` and `IO.println()` in JShell.
