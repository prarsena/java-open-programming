# 5.2 Passing Arguments to a Method

Methods become flexible and reusable when you allow them to accept **arguments** (or input).

## Parameters vs. Arguments

It is crucial to distinguish between the terminology:

- **Parameter:** The variable declared in the method header (definition) that acts as a placeholder to accept the value being passed in.
- **Argument:** The actual value, variable, or literal that is passed to the method when it is called.

The values you pass as arguments are received by the parameter variables in the method body in the order they appear.

**Example: Method with a Single Parameter**

If a method takes one input parameter, its functionality can change based on the argument provided.

```java
public static void welcomeUser(String name) { // 'name' is the parameter
   System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
   welcomeUser("Alice"); // "Alice" is the argument
   welcomeUser("Bob");   // "Bob" is the argument
}
```

## Arguments and Parameter Data Type Compatibility

When calling a method, the data type of the argument must be compatible with the data type of the corresponding parameter variable.

Java typically allows **widening conversions** automatically (e.g., passing an `int` argument to a `double` parameter), but strict adherence to the parameter types is necessary. 

If a method expects a `double` and then an `int`, you must provide a `double` followed by an `int`.

## Passing by Value (Primitives)

In Java, all primitive arguments (like `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`) are **passed by value**. This means that when you pass a primitive variable to a method, **only a copy of its value is passed** to the parameter variable.

**Changes made to the parameter inside the method do not affect the original argument outside the method**.

## Example: Pass by Value

```java
public class PassByValue {
   public static void changeValue(int num) {
      num = 100; // Changes the COPY stored in parameter 'num'
      System.out.println("Inside method: num = " + num);
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int x = 10;
      System.out.println("Before call: x = " + x); // x is 10
      changeValue(x); // A copy of 10 is passed
      System.out.println("After call: x = " + x);  // x is still 10
   }
}

/*
Output:
Before call: x = 10
Inside method: num = 100
After call: x = 10
*/
```

## Passing Object References

When an object (a non-primitive type, like `String`, `Scanner`, or a custom class) is passed as an argument, it is actually a **copy of the reference (memory address)** to the object that is passed.

Because the method receives a reference to the actual object in memory, the method can access and modify the original object's fields and call its methods. 

The one major exception is the **String class**, which is **immutable**—meaning its contents cannot be changed once the object is created. Operations that appear to change a String actually create a new String object.

## Example: Passing a Custom Object Reference

If you pass a custom object (like a `Car` object), the receiving method can update the object's instance fields.

```java
// Assume Car class has a public setter method: setAvailable(boolean status)
public class ObjectPasser {
    // Method that accepts a Car object reference
    public static void updateCarStatus(Car carReference) {
        // Use the reference to modify the original object in memory
        carReference.setAvailable(false); 
        System.out.println("Car status updated inside method.");
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Car myCar = new Car(true); // Assume initial status is true
        // updateCarStatus(myCar); 
        // // After the call, myCar's actual status has been permanently changed to false
    }
}
```

### Check Your Understanding (5.2)
1. What is the fundamental difference between a parameter and an argument?
2. If you pass an `int` variable (a primitive) to a method, and the method internally changes the value of the parameter, why does the original `int` variable remain unchanged?
3. When a method receives an object as an argument, what specific piece of information is actually passed to the parameter variable?
4. Given the method header `public static void processData(int age, double salary)`, which of the following method calls is valid: `processData(30.0, 50000)` or `processData(30, 50000.0)`? Explain why.

### Practice Problems (5.2)
1. Write a static void method called `calculateTotal` that accepts two parameters: a `double` named `price` and an `int` named `quantity`. The method should calculate and print the total cost (`price * quantity`). Show how to call this method passing a price of `15.99` and a quantity of `5`.
2. Assume you have a custom object `Student`. Write a method header for a method named `displayStudentInfo` that accepts one argument of type `Student`. Explain why this method would be typically declared as `static` if it resides in an executable class.
