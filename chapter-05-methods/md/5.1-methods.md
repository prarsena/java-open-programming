# 5.1 Introduction to Methods

Methods are foundational components in Java programming. They are reusable pieces of code, sometimes called **functions** in other languages, that allow you to perform a specific task, often on an object. 

The use of methods enables two primary benefits: 

- **Code reuse** 
- **Functional decomposition**—the process of breaking a large, complex problem down into smaller, manageable sub-problems

## Method Structure

Every method consists of two parts: 

1. **Header** (or signature)
2. **Body**

## Method Header

The **Method Header** defines the method's characteristics and includes:

1. **Method Modifiers** (e.g., `public`, `static`)
2. **Return Type** (e.g., `void`, `int`, `String`)
3. **Method Name**
4. **Parameter List** (written in parentheses)

Here are some examples of method headers:

```java
public static void printName(String name)
/* 
Method Name: printName 
Modifiers: public, static
Return type: nothing
Input Parameters: name (String)
*/

public static int squareNumber(int number)
/* 
Method Name: squareNumber 
Modifiers: public, static
Return type: int
Input Parameters: number (int)
*/

public static String greetStudent(String studentName)
/* 
Method Name: greetStudent
Modifiers: public, static
Return type: String
Input Parameters: studentName (String)
*/

public static String greetStudentFromTeacher(String studentName, String teacherName)
/* 
Method Name: greetStudentFromTeacher
Modifiers: public, static
Return type: String
Input Parameters: studentName (String), teacherName (String)
*/
```

## Method Body

The **Method Body** contains the collection of statements enclosed in curly braces `{}` that are executed when the method is called.

```java
public static void greetUser(String name) {
    // Method body starts here with opening brace
    System.out.println("Welcome, " + name + "!");
    System.out.println("Hope you enjoy learning Java.");
    // Method body ends here with closing brace
}
``` 
## Method Types: Void vs. Value-Returning

Methods are typically categorized by what they return:

1. **Void Methods:** These methods perform a task and then terminate without sending any value back to the calling code. They are often used for tasks like displaying information (e.g., printing to the console).

2. **Value-Returning Methods:** These methods perform a task (often a calculation or retrieval) and use the `return` statement to send a single value or object reference back to the code that called it. The return type must be explicitly defined in the method header.

## Method Modifiers: Static vs. Instance

Method modifiers define the access and behavior of a method. The most important non-access modifier to understand is `static`.

- **Static Methods** (Class Methods): These methods **belong to the class itself** rather than any specific instance (object). They can be called directly on the class name without needing to create an object first, such as `Math.random()`.

- **Instance Methods** (Non-Static Methods): These methods **belong to an object** and operate on that object's specific data (fields). They require you to create an instance of the class (using `new`) before they can be called, such as `myRandom.nextInt(100)`.

Before we introduce writing our own classes, our methods will primarily be **static**.

## Calling a Method

A method only executes when it is called. The `main` method is special because the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) calls it automatically when the program starts. Other methods must be executed by a **method call statement**.

A method call statement includes:

- The method name
- Arguments (if any) inside parentheses
- Followed by a semicolon

Importantly, method modifiers and the return type are **not** included in the method call statement; they are only used in the method header.

**Example: Defining and Calling a Simple Void Method**

This example demonstrates a simple `static` method that is called from `main`.

```java
public class SimpleMethod {
   public static void displayHeader() { // Method definition (Header + Body)
      // Method Body
      System.out.println("----------------------------------------");
      System.out.println("  Method displayHeader() is Executing   ");
      System.out.println("----------------------------------------");
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Program starting...");
      displayHeader(); // Method Call
      System.out.println("Program ending.");
   }
}
```

## Layered Method Calls

Methods can call other methods, leading to **layered method calls** (or a call stack). When a called method finishes execution, control is returned to the line immediately following the call in the calling method.

When method A calls B, B is called and finishes, then control returns to A.

```java
public class LayeredCallDemo {
    public static void methodA() {
        System.out.println("  2.  In methodA: Calling methodB.");
        methodB(); // Execution pauses here and jumps to methodB
        System.out.println("  4.  In methodA: Back from methodB. Finishing methodA.");
    }

    public static void methodB() {
        System.out.println("      3.  In methodB: Deepest point.");
        // methodB finishes, control returns to methodA
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("1.  In main: Calling methodA.");
        methodA(); // Program execution pauses here and jumps to methodA
        System.out.println("5.  In main: Back from methodA. Program finishing.");
    }
}
```

Here's the output of the `LayeredCallDemo` program:

```
1.  In main: Calling methodA.
  2.  In methodA: Calling methodB.
    3.  In methodB: Deepest Point.
  4.  In methodA: Back from methodB. Finishing methodA.
5.  In main: Back from methodA. Program finishing.
```

### Check Your Understanding (5.1)

1. What is the primary purpose of breaking a program down into smaller pieces (methods)?
2. Name the two main parts of a method declaration.
3. What is the return type of a method that performs a task but does not send any value back to the calling code?
4. Explain the difference between a `static` method and an instance method, and give an example of a built-in Java static method.

### Practice Problems (5.1)

1. Write a `public static void` method named `printGreeting` that takes no parameters and prints "Welcome to the Java Textbook Program!" to the console. Show how you would call this method from the `main` method.
2. Given the following method definition, write the single correct statement that would call this method:
    `public static void calculateArea(double length, double width)`
