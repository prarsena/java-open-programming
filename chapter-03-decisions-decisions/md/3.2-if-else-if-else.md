# 3.2 The `if-else` and `if-else-if` Statements

## The `if-else` Statement

The `if-else` statement provides an alternative path of execution. If the boolean expression is `true`, the `if` block executes. If it is `false`, the `else` block executes. The two blocks are mutually exclusive; one or the other will run, but never both.

```java
double score = 55.0;

if (score > 59.9) {
    System.out.println("You passed the class.");
} else {
    System.out.println("You did not pass the class.");
}
```

## Nested `if` Statements

An `if` statement can be placed inside another `if` or `else` block. This is called a **nested `if` statement** and is used for complex decisions where one condition depends on another.

```java
// Program determines if an applicant meets two conditions to qualify for a loan. 
double salary = 50000;
int yearsOnJob = 3;

if (salary >= 40000) {
    if (yearsOnJob >= 2) {
        System.out.println("You qualify for the loan.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("You must have been on your current job for at least two years.");
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("You must earn at least $40,000 per year.");
}
```

While useful, deeply nested `if` statements can become hard to read. Often, they can be simplified using logical operators.

## The `if-else-if` Statement

The `if-else-if` statement is perfect for testing a series of mutually exclusive conditions. The program evaluates each condition in order and executes the block for the **first one that is `true`**. Once a condition is met, the rest of the statement is skipped.

This structure is more efficient than a series of independent `if` statements, because in that case, every `if` statement would be checked, regardless of the outcome of the others.

```java
int testScore = 78;
char grade;

if (testScore < 60) {
    grade = 'F';
} else if (testScore < 70) {
    grade = 'D';
} else if (testScore < 80) {
    grade = 'C';
} else if (testScore < 90) {
    grade = 'B';
} else {
    grade = 'A';
}
System.out.println("Your grade is " + grade); // Prints: Your grade is C
```

An important point to remember when learning if-else-if statements is that every condition except the final `else` statement includes a Boolean expression. `else` is the catch-all if no condition has been met through the series of `if` and `else if` statements.

## Check Your Understanding

1. In an `if-else` statement, when is the code block following the `else` executed?
2. What is the key difference in execution flow between a series of separate `if` statements and a single `if-else-if` statement?
3. When would a nested `if` statement be more appropriate than an `if-else-if` statement? Provide an example scenario.

## Practice Problems

1. Write an `if-else` statement that checks if a `double` variable named `accountBalance` is less than 0. If it is, print "Account overdrawn." Otherwise, print "Account in good standing."
2. Convert the following nested `if` statement into a single `if` statement using a logical operator.

```java
int age = 25;
boolean hasLicense = true;
if (age >= 16) {
	if (hasLicense) {
		System.out.println("You are eligible to drive.");
	}
}
```

3. A program needs to assign a shipping cost based on a package's weight. Write an `if-else-if` statement that assigns a value to a `double shippingCost` variable based on the `double weight` variable according to these rules:
    *   Weight under 2 lbs: cost is $5.50
    *   Weight from 2 lbs up to 10 lbs: cost is $12.00
    *   Weight 10 lbs or more: cost is $18.25
