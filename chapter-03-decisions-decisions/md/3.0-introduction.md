In the previous chapter, we explored the fundamentals of Java, including variables, data types, and basic operations. Programs written with only these concepts execute sequentially, one line after another. This chapter introduces **decision structures**, which empower your programs to make choices and follow different paths based on specific conditions. This control over the flow of execution is a fundamental concept in programming.

### What you will learn
In this chapter, you will learn how to:

- Understand and use the `if`, `if-else`, and `if-else-if` statements to control program flow.
- Form conditions using **Relational and Logical Operators**.
- Implement complex logic with **nested `if` statements**.
- Use boolean variables as **flags** to track program states.
- Compare primitive `char` types and non-primitive `String` objects.
- Use the **conditional (ternary) operator** for concise `if-else` logic.
- Create multi-branch decisions with the **`switch` statement**.
- Format output precisely using `System.out.printf` and `String.format`.
