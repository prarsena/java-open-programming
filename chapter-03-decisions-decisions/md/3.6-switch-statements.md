# 3.6 The `switch` Statement

The `switch` statement provides another way to create a multi-branch decision structure. It is ideal when you need to check a single variable or expression against a series of discrete values (`case`).

Java has evolved its `switch` syntax. **Modern Java (version 14+) introduces a more concise "arrow syntax" (`->`) that eliminates the need for `break` statements and allows the `switch` to be used as an expression that returns a value**.

## Modern `switch` Example

The modern syntax is cleaner and less error-prone. Here, the `switch` expression determines the value of `monthName` and assigns it directly.

``` java
int month = 2;
String monthName = switch (month) {
    case 1 -> "January";
    case 2 -> "February";
    case 3 -> "March";
    // ... other months
    default -> "Invalid month";
};
System.out.println(monthName); // Prints: February
```

The arrow syntax ensures that only the code for the matching case is executed, preventing "fall-through" errors common with the classic syntax. If you need to execute multiple statements for a case, you can use curly braces and the `yield` keyword to return a value.

```java
int choice = 1;
String result = switch (choice) {
    case 1 -> {
        System.out.println("Performing action one...");
        yield "Completed action 1";
    }
    case 2 -> "Completed action 2";
    default -> "Invalid choice";
};
```

## Classic `switch` Syntax

The classic syntax is still valid but is more verbose and requires a `break` statement at the end of each `case` block to prevent execution from "falling through" to the next case.

```java
int month = 2;
String monthName;

switch (month) {
    case 1:
        monthName = "January";
        break;
    case 2:
        monthName = "February";
        break;
    case 3:
        monthName = "March";
        break;
    // ... other months
    default:
        monthName = "Invalid month";
        break;
}
System.out.println(monthName);
```


## Check Your Understanding

1.  What is the purpose of the `break` statement in a classic `switch` statement? What problem does the modern arrow (`->`) syntax solve?
2.  When would a `switch` statement be a better choice than a long `if-else-if` statement?
3.  In modern Java, what is the purpose of the `yield` keyword within a `switch` expression?

## Practice Problems

1. Write a modern `switch` statement that takes a `char` variable `grade` and prints "Excellent" for 'A', "Good" for 'B', "Average" for 'C', and "Needs Improvement" for any other grade.
