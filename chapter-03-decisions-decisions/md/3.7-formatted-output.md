# 3.7 Displaying Formatted Output

Often, you need more control over how output is displayed, such as setting the number of decimal places for a floating-point number or aligning text in columns. Java provides two powerful methods for this: `System.out.printf` and `String.format`.

## `System.out.printf`

The `printf` method (short for "print formatted") allows you to format and print data in one step. It takes a **format string** containing text and **format specifiers**, followed by a list of arguments that correspond to those specifiers.

Common format specifiers include:

- `%d`: for integers (`int`, `long`)
- `%f`: for floating-point numbers (`double`, `float`)
- `%s`: for strings
- `%c`: for characters

```java
String name = "Alice";
int age = 30;
double salary = 75000.5;

System.out.printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Salary: %,.2f\n", name, age, salary);
```

**Output:** 
`Name: Alice, Age: 30, Salary: 75,000.50`

For numeric 

### Decimal Formatting: %,.2f

Decimal formatting is one of the most common use cases for `printf`. A key formula to remember for representing money is `%,.2f` because this rounds the number to two decimal places and places a comma in the appropriate positions.     

Here's a further explanation of `%,.2f`: 

- The percentage sign (`%`) indicates a formatted variable definition will follow.
- The comma (`,`) is a flag to add thousand separators.
- The `.2` specifies a precision of two decimal places.
- The `f` tells Java to process the variable as a floating-point number (a `double`).

You can also specify a **minimum field width** to align output in columns. By default, output is right-aligned. Use a minus sign (`-`) flag for left alignment.

```java
System.out.printf("%-10s %10.2f\n", "Item A:", 12.5);
System.out.printf("%-10s %10.2f\n", "Item B:", 250.75);
```

**Output:**

```bash
Item A:        12.50
Item B:       250.75
```

### Formatted Decimal Rounding
By default, Java's `printf` uses **Rounding Mode: HALF_UP**.

This means:
- If the discarded fraction is **< .5**, it rounds down.
- If the discarded fraction is **≥ .5**, it rounds up.

**Examples:**

| **Original Value** | **Format** | **Result** | **Reason**                                      |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `3.14159`          | `%.3f`     | `3.142`    | The 4th digit is 5, so the 3rd digit rounds up. |
| `3.14149`          | `%.3f`     | `3.141`    | The 4th digit is 4, so it stays down.           |
| `1.5`              | `%.0f`     | `2`        | .5 rounds up.                                   |
| `2.5`              | `%.0f`     | `3`        | .5 rounds up.                                   |

## `String.format()`

The `String.format()` method works exactly like `printf` but instead of printing the output to the console, it **returns the formatted string as a `String` object**. You can then store this string in a variable for later use.

```java
double price = 19.99;
int quantity = 3;
double total = price * quantity;

String output = String.format("Total cost: $%.2f", total);

// You can now use the 'output' string elsewhere
IO.println(output); // Prints: Total cost: $59.97
```

This is useful when you need to build a formatted string to be used in a GUI, saved to a file, or sent over a network.

#### Check Your Understanding (3.7)

1.  What is the key difference between `System.out.printf()` and `String.format()`?
2.  In the format specifier `%,10.2f`, explain what the comma (`,`), the `10`, and the `.2` each do.
#### Practice Problems (3.7)

1. You need to generate a log message that will be saved to a file. The message should be "User: \[username], ID: \[id]". The username is a `String` and the id is an `int`. Use `String.format()` to create this message and store it in a `String` variable called `logEntry`.
