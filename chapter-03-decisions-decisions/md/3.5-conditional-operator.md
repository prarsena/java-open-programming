# 3.5 The Conditional (Ternary) Operator

The **conditional operator**, also known as the **ternary operator**, is a compact way to write a simple `if-else` statement. It is called "ternary" because it takes three operands.

**Syntax:** 

```java
booleanExpression ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse;
```

Consider this `if-else` block:

```java
int hours = 3;
int billableHours;

if (hours < 5) {
    billableHours = 5;
} else {
    billableHours = hours;
}
```

Using the ternary operator, this can be written in a single line:

```java
int hours = 3;
int billableHours = (hours < 5) ? 5 : hours; // billableHours will be 5
```

This operator is useful for simple conditional assignments, setting default values, or conditional printing.

#### Check Your Understanding (3.5)

1. Why is the conditional operator referred to as the "ternary" operator?
2. The ternary operator can make code more concise. Can you think of a situation where using a standard `if-else` statement would be more readable and thus a better choice?
#### Practice Problems (3.5)

1. Rewrite the following `if-else` statement using the conditional (ternary) operator.

```java
int points = 95;
String result;
if (points > 90) {
	result = "Excellent";
} else {
	result = "Good";
}
```
