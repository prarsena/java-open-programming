# 3.3 Logical Operators

**Logical operators** (`&&`, `||`, `!`) are used to combine or modify Boolean expressions.

- `&&` (**AND**): Returns `true` only if both expressions are true.
- `||` (**OR**): Returns `true` if at least one expression is true.
- `!` (**NOT**): Reverses the logical state of an expression. It's a **unary operator** because it works on a single operand.

Here's a table with an example of each:

| Operator | Meaning         | Example  | Result (if p=true,q=false) |
| -------- | --------------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| &&       | **Logical AND** | p && q   | `false`                    |
| \|\|     | **Logical OR**  | p \|\| q | `true`                     |
| !        | **Logical NOT** | !p       | `false`                    |

Logical operators can simplify nested `if` statements. The loan qualifier example could be rewritten as:

```java
double salary = 50000;
int yearsOnJob = 3;

if (salary >= 40000 && yearsOnJob >= 2) {
    IO.println("You qualify for the loan.");
} else {
    IO.println("You do not qualify for the loan.");
}
```

This is useful for checking numeric ranges. For example, to test if `temp` is between 0 and 100 inclusive, you would use the `&&` operator.

```java
int temp = 75;
if (temp >= 0 && temp <= 100) {
    IO.println("Temperature is within the valid range.");
}
```

Similarly, you can combine multiple conditions, such as testing if `x` is within a range OR if `y` has a certain value.

```java
int x = 550;
int y = 2000;

// Test if x is between 500 and 650 (exclusive) OR y is not equal to 1000.
if ((x > 500 && x < 650) || (y != 1000)) {
    IO.println("The condition is true.");
}
```

#### Check Your Understanding (3.3)

1.  Name the three logical operators and describe what each one does.
2.  For the `&&` (AND) operator to return `true`, what must be true about its operands? What about for the `||` (OR) operator?
3.  The `!` operator is a unary operator. What does this mean, and how does it differ from operators like `&&` and `+`?
#### Practice Problems (3.3)

1. Write a boolean expression that would be `true` if an `int` variable `x` is between, but not including, 500 and 650.
2. What is the output of the following code snippet? Explain your reasoning.

```java
boolean isMember = false;
int age = 67;
if (isMember || age > 65) {
	IO.println("Discount applies.");
} else {
	IO.println("No discount.");
}
```
