# 3.4 Comparing `String` Objects

A common pitfall is using the `==` operator to compare `String` objects. Because strings are objects, the `==` operator compares their memory addresses, not their contents. While it may sometimes appear to work, it is unreliable.

To compare the actual text content of two strings, you **must use the `.equals()` method**.

```java
String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = "Hello";
String str3 = "Goodbye";

// Correct way to compare strings for equality
if (str1.equals(str2)) { // This is true
    System.out.println("str1 and str2 are equal.");
}

if (str1.equals(str3)) { // This is false
    System.out.println("str1 and str3 are equal.");
} else {
    System.out.println("str1 and str3 are NOT equal.");
}
```

If you want to compare strings while ignoring differences in capitalization, use the `.equalsIgnoreCase()` method.

```java
String username1 = "Admin";
String username2 = "admin";

if (username1.equalsIgnoreCase(username2)) { // This is true
    System.out.println("Usernames are the same, ignoring case.");
}
```

## Check Your Understanding

1. Why is it incorrect to use the `==` operator to compare the contents of two `String` objects? What does `==` actually compare when used with objects?
2. Describe a situation where using the `.equalsIgnoreCase()` method would be more appropriate than the `.equals()` method.
## Practice Problems

1. Given `String pass1 = "secret";` and a `Scanner` object to read user input into a `String pass2`, write an `if-else` statement that correctly checks if the user's input matches `pass1` and prints "Access granted" or "Access denied" accordingly.
