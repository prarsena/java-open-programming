# 3.1 The `if` Statement, Boolean Expressions, and Relational Operators

The `if` statement is the most basic decision structure. It uses a **Boolean expression** to conditionally execute a block of code. If the expression evaluates to `true`, the code block runs; otherwise, it is skipped.

```java
int score = 85;

if (score > 59) {
    IO.println("Congratulations, you passed!");
}
```

## Using Relational Operators to Form Conditions
To create these conditions, `if` statements rely on **Boolean expressions**. A Boolean expression is a statement that evaluates to either `true` or `false`. These expressions are often formed using **relational operators** to compare values.

| Operator | Meaning                  | Example   | Result (if x=10, y=5) |
| :------- | :----------------------- | :-------- | :-------------------- |
| `>`      | Greater than             | `x > y`   | `true`                |
| `<`      | Less than                | `x < y`   | `false`               |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to | `x >= 10` | `true`                |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    | `y <= 5`  | `true`                |
| `==`     | Equal to                 | `x == y`  | `false`               |
| `!=`     | Not equal to             | `x != y`  | `true`                |

## Boolean expressions
**Boolean expressions** use Relational Operators to evaluate whether a statement is true or false. Here are some examples:

- `is 4 < 3?` **false**
- `is 25 > 5 ?` **true**

Program execution is determined by the result of Boolean expressions.
## Programming Style and the `if` Statement

A block of code is enclosed in a set of curly braces `{ }`. While Java allows you to omit the curly braces if there is only a single statement to be executed, it is highly recommended to **always use them**.

This is valid, but not recommended:

```java
if (score > 59)
    IO.println("You passed!");
```

This is the recommended style:

```java
if (score > 59) {
    IO.println("You passed!");
}
```

Using braces consistently improves readability, helps you understand code scope, and is required if you need to execute multiple statements conditionally.

> 📖 **a worthwhile aside**: I prefer to use [Egyptian Brackets](https://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/#3) (also called K&R style), which are seen in the above example. This is the style used by the Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie in their legendary textbook [The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) in 1978. 
> 
> The alternative is where each brace gets its own line. Read more about [Notable Indentation Styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Notable_styles). See the Allman (also called BSD) Style.

## Boolean Flags

A **flag** is a `boolean` variable used to signal whether a condition exists. This is a common and important practice that allows you to check the current state of an operation.

For example, we can set a `passingScore` flag to `true` only if a student passes. Later in the program, we can check this flag to perform another action.

```java
boolean passingScore = false;
double score = 72.5;

if (score > 59.9) {
    passingScore = true;
}

// Some other code might be here...

if (passingScore) {
    IO.println("This student is eligible for the next course.");
}
```

This technique is useful in many scenarios, such as tracking whether a user is logged in. An application can show limited content when a `userLoggedIn` flag is `false` and reveal more options once it becomes `true`.

## Comparing Characters

Because `char` is a primitive type, its value is stored directly in memory as a Unicode number. This means you can use relational operators to compare characters based on their numeric order.

- 'B' is greater than 'A' because its Unicode value is higher.
- 'a' is greater than 'A' because uppercase letters have lower Unicode values than lowercase letters.

> 📝**Reference note**: The Wikipedia article, [List of Unicode Characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters#Basic_Latin), lists the numerical (decimal) values of each Unicode character. 
> 
> The capital letter 'A' has a decimal value of 65, while 'B' has a value of 66, and so forth. The lowercase letter 'a' has a decimal value of 97, while 'b' has a value of 98.

```java
char letter = 'B';

if (letter > 'A') {
    System.out.println("The letter is after A in the alphabet.");
}

// Example from quiz3.md
char grade = 'C';
if (grade != 'A') { // This correctly checks if grade is NOT 'A'
    System.out.println("This is not an A grade.");
}
```

This is a correct way to determine if the `char` variable `grade` is not equal to 'A'.

One takeaway from this section is that characters are compared using relational operators because `char` is a primitive data type, like `int` or `double`. Strings are Java objects, or non-primitive data types, so we use a String method (`.equals()` or `.equalsIgnoreCase()`) to compare Strings. 


#### Check Your Understanding (3.1)

1. What is the primary purpose of an `if` statement in a program?
2. A Boolean expression, which is required by an `if` statement, must evaluate to what two possible values?
3. Explain the difference between the `=` and `==` operators. Why is using `=` inside an `if` condition a common error?
4. Why is it highly recommended to always use curly braces `{}` with `if` statements, even for a single line of code?
5. What is a boolean "flag"? Describe a real-world scenario (other than user login) where you might use a flag to control a program's logic.

#### Practice Problems (3.1)

1. Write a Java `if` statement that checks if the value of an `int` variable `temperature` is greater than 98.6. If it is, print "You have a fever."
2.  Given `char initial = 'D';`, write an `if` statement that prints "This is one of the first four letters of the alphabet" if `initial` is 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'D'. (Hint: you can use `||` or multiple `if` statements, but think about which is more efficient).
