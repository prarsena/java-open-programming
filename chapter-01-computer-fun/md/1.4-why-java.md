# 1.4 Why Java?
After learning the foundational concepts of computer systems, programming languages, and software development, we move on to discuss the topic we're here to learn: Java. 

The last section mentioned that Java is a compiled, high-level programming language that tries to balance the power and expressiveness of low-level languages with the portability and developer experience improvements of high-level languages.  

This section aims to describe Java's history, philosophy, and role in software development so that you gain a sense of why Java is and continues to be a solid choice for a programming language. 

## Java Then
The story of Java begins in late 1990 with a small, isolated group of Sun Microsystems engineers led by **James Gosling**. Their secretive mission, initially called the **Green Project**, was chartered by Sun to anticipate the next wave in computing: combining digitally-controlled consumer devices (like VCRs, TVs, cable boxes, and other appliances) with computers. 

The team, comprising only 13 people, deliberately cut off regular communications with Sun and worked around the clock for 18 months in an anonymous office on Sand Hill Road in Silicon Valley. Their goal was to build a platform-independent, distributed system for embedded electronics, like VCRs, elevators, locomotives, and interactive TV set-top boxes.

Gosling initially tried to adapt C and C++ to build the systems, but found fundamental issues—like manual memory management and platform-specific compilation—too deeply embedded in the languages. He concluded that a new language, designed from the ground up to be portable, secure, and reliable, was the only way to achieve the Green Project's goals. This new language, initially called **Oak**, was designed with features like automatic memory management (garbage collection) and a virtual machine that allowed code to run on any device without recompilation.

An inspiration for this new software came to Gosling while attending a Doobie Brothers concert. He described the experience to a reporter in 1995, who wrote:

> As he sat slouched in front-row seats letting the music wash over him, Gosling looked up at wiring and speakers and semi-robotic lights that seemed to dance to the music. "I kept seeing imaginary packets flowing down the wires making everything happen,'' he recalls. "I'd been thinking a lot about making behavior flow through networks in a fairly narrow way. During the concert, I broke through on a pile of technical issues. **I got a deep feeling about how far this could all go: weaving networks and computers into even fine details of everyday life.'**' 

In the summer of 1992, the Green Team unveiled their working demo: a handheld home-entertainment device controller called **Star7**, featuring an animated touchscreen interface where the Java's now-famous mascot, **Duke**, made his debut. This device ran on the processor-independent Oak, embodying Gosling's principle of **"write once, run anywhere."**

Despite this innovation, the team struggled to find a market for their technology in the nascent interactive TV industry, losing bids to companies like Time-Warner. Facing a dead end, an epiphany occurred to the team in 1994: **"Why not the Internet?"**. 

The emerging World Wide Web was transforming into the interactive network they had initially envisioned for cable TV. The team quickly developed **WebRunner** (later renamed **HotJava**), a Java-based browser that brought "animated, moving objects and dynamic executable content inside a Web browser" for the first time. 

James Gosling and (Sun director) James Gage captivated an influential audience with a legendary demonstration of WebRunner at the **TED Conference in early 1995** by dragging a rotating 3D molecule through the middle of text on a web page. The impact of the event was described in an article about the early years of Java: 

> Gosling moved the mouse over an illustration of a 3D molecule in the middle of the text. The 3D molecule rotated with the mouse movement. Back and forth, up and around. "The entire audience went \`Aaaaaaah!'" says Gosling. "Their view of reality had completely changed because it MOVED." Now everyone was paying close attention. Suddenly, everyone in the room was rethinking the potential of the Internet. [2]

This public debut led to an overwhelming demand for Java's code, with the team jumping for joy with each download. An unexpected front-page story in the San Jose Mercury News and **Netscape's announcement on May 23, 1995, to incorporate Java into Navigator** solidly positioned Java as The Next Big Thing for the Internet. 

While applets initially aimed for client-side Web dominance, Java's unexpected and massive success came on the server side due to the JVM's strengths in building reliable, concurrent, and dynamically linked software.

## Java Now
**Java** and its **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** have proven themselves as foundational technologies in enterprise software development. Java's robustness, powerful features, and comprehensive standard library make it a reliable choice for building large, scalable, and secure applications. The extensive ecosystem of frameworks (like Spring) and tools further cements its popularity for mission-critical systems and microservices.

Java's core principle is **write once, run anywhere**. This is achieved by compiling Java source code into an intermediate format called **bytecode**. This bytecode is not tied to a specific machine architecture or operating system. Instead, it's the job of the JVM to interpret and execute this bytecode. Since a JVM implementation exists for virtually every platform—from servers and desktops to mobile devices—the same compiled bytecode can run on any system that has a compatible JVM, ensuring a consistent execution environment regardless of the underlying hardware.

The JVM's design makes it a highly flexible and language-agnostic platform. It doesn't exclusively run Java; it runs **bytecode**. This means that any programming language can run on the JVM as long as it has a compiler that can translate its source code into the correct bytecode format. This flexibility has given rise to a rich ecosystem of languages like **Kotlin**, **Scala**, and **Groovy**, which all leverage the JVM's performance optimizations, robust garbage collection, and massive library ecosystem while offering different programming paradigms and syntax.

Here are a few organizations that use Java:

## Java Philosophy and Architecture 
I won't say that Java is the perfect programming language, but I do appreciate how it combines good ideas from both the low-level and the high-level languages to give developers a powerful and intuitive experience. 

But Java isn't just a programming language, it's also the environment where Java applications run. The Java platform includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Application Programming Interface (API), and the Java Development Kit (JDK). 

Learning the philosophy behind the Java programming language and the architecture of the Java platform will empower you to effectively choose, use, and even create the tools and libraries you need to build Java applications. 

## What makes the Java language different?

- **Platform Independence:** Java uses a "Virtual Machine" (JVM). You compile code once into bytecode, and it runs on any device (Windows, Mac, Linux, or Cloud) without changes. **"Write Once, Run Anywhere."**
- **Automatic Memory Management:** Unlike older languages (C/C++), Java has a **Garbage Collector**. It automatically cleans up unused memory, preventing crashes and making development much safer for beginners.
- **Strongly Typed & Compiled:** Java is strict. It checks your variable types (e.g., String vs. Integer) _before_ the program runs. This catches bugs at "compile-time" rather than crashing while a user is using the app.
- **Object-Oriented (OOP) by Design:** Java is built to organize code into "Objects." This makes it the industry standard for building massive, complex systems because it forces modularity and reusability.
- **Enterprise Security & Robustness:** Designed for high-stakes environments, Java includes built-in security features and strict error handling that prevent programs from interfering with the host computer's operating system.

## What is the Java platform?
The Java platform is called the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**. The JRE is the bundle that provides the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** and the **Java API** libraries. It's everything an end-user needs to run a Java application.

In order to write, compile, and run Java code, developers install the **Java Development Kit (JDK)**. The JDK is a comprehensive software development kit that includes everything in the JRE, plus additional tools needed for developing, compiling, and debugging Java applications. 

Some of the most important JDK tools include:

- `javac`: The **Java compiler**, which translates your human-readable Java code (`.java` files) into Java bytecode (`.class` files).
- `java`: The program launcher, which starts the JVM to run your compiled bytecode.
- `jdb`: The **Java debugger**, a command-line tool for finding and fixing errors in your code.
- `jar`: The **archiver**, which packages multiple `.class` files and other resources into a single, distributable `.jar` file.
- `javadoc`: A tool that generates HTML documentation from comments in your source code.
- `jshell`: An interactive tool for quickly experimenting with Java code.

## Who makes the JDK?
Historically, Oracle (and previously Sun Microsystems) was the primary provider of the JDK. However, due to licensing changes and the open-sourcing of Java, multiple vendors now provide their own builds of the JDK.

**Open source** means that the source code is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. This fosters decentralized and collaborative development, peer review, and often leads to lower costs, more flexibility, and greater longevity compared to proprietary software.

Sun Microsystems open-sourced the JDK in 2006 to increase Java adoption and community involvement, and ultimately drive more sales to their hardware. After acquiring Sun Microsystems in 2010, **Oracle** continued the open-source effort, but also released a commercial version of the JDK. 

The source code for the JDK is here: [https://github.com/openjdk/jdk](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk). You are free to download it, alter it in any way you see fit, and redistribute it. 

However, because this could lead to incompatibilities, it's best to stick to a reputable JDK provider. Some prominent JDK providers include:

- **OpenJDK (Oracle's build)**: Oracle itself provides free production-ready OpenJDK binaries.
- **Eclipse Temurin (formerly AdoptOpenJDK)**: A widely used, free, and verified OpenJDK distribution developed under the Eclipse Foundation.
- **Amazon Corretto**: A no-cost, long-term supported distribution from Amazon.
- **Red Hat OpenJDK**: Red Hat is an active contributor to the OpenJDK project and provides free distributions.
- **IBM Semeru Runtime (with OpenJ9 JVM)**: IBM provides builds based on the OpenJDK class libraries and their own OpenJ9 JVM, which is known for low memory usage.
- **Microsoft Build of OpenJDK**: Microsoft also released its own free and long-term supported OpenJDK distribution.
- **SapMachine**: An SAP-supported version of OpenJDK.
- **BellSoft Liberica JDK**: A 100% open-source Java implementation built from OpenJDK.

## What is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) provides a runtime environment for Java programs and other languages that compile to Java bytecode. Think of it as an small computer within your computer whose only job is to run Java programs.

Here's how the JVM works:

1. **Loads Bytecode**: The JVM loads Java bytecode (which is the compiled form of your Java source code) into its memory.
2. **Verifies Bytecode**: It performs bytecode verification to ensure the code is safe and adheres to Java language specifications.
3. **Manages Memory**: The JVM manages memory allocation for objects and uses automatic garbage collection to reclaim memory from objects that are no longer needed.
4. **Executes Bytecode**: It executes bytecode instructions. It may use an interpreter to execute instructions one by one, and often employs a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler to dynamically translate frequently executed bytecode into optimized native machine code for better performance.
5. **Platform Independence**: By abstracting the underlying hardware and operating system, the JVM provides a consistent execution environment, enabling Java's "write once, run anywhere" capability.

The default JVM included with most Java distributions is called **HotSpot**. There are other types of JVM, such as GraalVM and the Android Runtime, that focus on supporting different types of systems. HotSpot is a **Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler**, and its primary philosophy is **adaptive optimization**.

## What is the Java API?
The **Java API (Application Programming Interface)** is a vast collection of pre-written packages, classes, and interfaces that provide a standardized way for developers to interact with various functionalities. 

The Java API is a rich library of pre-built code that saves developers significant time and effort, allowing them to focus on the unique logic of their applications rather than building everything from scratch. It offers functionalities for a wide range of tasks, from basic operations like mathematical functions to complex features for database connectivity, web development, networking, security, and more. 

The source code for the base Java API classes is here:

> 🎞️ **Coming attractions**: When you use `System.out.println()` or `Scanner` in your code, you are utilizing classes and methods provided by the Java API. We'll see these in the next chapter.
