# 1.3 Programming Environments

## Programming Paradigms 
A programming paradigm is a fundamental style of structuring a program. Three prominent paradigms are procedural programming, object-oriented programming (OOP), and functional programming.

- **Procedural programming** is a paradigm based on the concept of the **procedure call**. In this approach, a program is structured as a series of instructions that tell the computer what to do step-by-step. Data is passed between functions or procedures, and the program's control flow is top-down. The main program is responsible for calling these procedures to perform tasks. 
  - Languages popular in this paradigm include **C, Fortran, and Pascal**. Scripting languages such as **Python, JavaScript, and PowerShell** can be written procedurally. 
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) is a paradigm that structures a program around **objects**. An object is a self-contained unit that encapsulates both data (its **state**) and the procedures (its **behavior** or **methods**) that operate on that data. This is a significant departure from procedural programming, where data and procedures are separate. The core idea of OOP is to model real-world entities. For example, a program for a car dealership might have a `Car` object with data like `color`, `make`, and `model`, and methods like `startEngine()` or `accelerate()`.
  - **Java** is an example of an object-oriented language. It is often used to build complex, scalable, and maintainable applications because of its organized, modular nature. Other popular OOP languages include **Python, C++, and C#**.
- **Functional programming** is a paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing **functions**. Its key characteristics include treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoiding state and mutable data. This means that a function's output depends only on its inputs, not on any external or hidden state, which makes it easier to reason about and test code.
  - Functional programming is used in many modern languages, and **Java** has incorporated some functional features, such as lambda expressions, since Java 8. Popular languages in this paradigm include **Haskell, Lisp, and Scala**.

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
While programs can be written in simple text editors like Notepad, they are often developed using **Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)** , which offer numerous advantages beyond basic text editing. 

An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. It typically consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.

IDEs provide features like **autocomplete**, **syntax highlighting**, and the ability to **run, test, and debug programs** from a single interface. They also integrate with **version control systems** like Git, making it easier to manage code changes, and include **refactoring tools** to safely restructure code.

IDEs can be either general-purpose, supporting many languages, or specialized, optimized for a specific language or a small set of related languages. 

Here are some of the most popular IDEs:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A highly popular, free, and open-source code editor that has become a de facto standard for many developers due to its lightweight nature and extensive marketplace of extensions. It supports a huge number of languages, including JavaScript, Python, C++, and Java.
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Considered one of the best IDEs for **Java** development, IntelliJ IDEA is known for its smart code completion, on-the-fly error highlighting, and powerful tools for refactoring and debugging.
- **PyCharm**: An IDE from the same company as IntelliJ IDEA, designed specifically for **Python**. It's widely used for web development, data science, and machine learning with Python.
- **Xcode**: **Apple's** proprietary IDE, used exclusively for developing applications for iOS and macOS using languages like Swift and Objective-C. It includes a built-in GUI builder and a device simulator.
- **Android Studio**: The official IDE for **Android** app development. It is tailored for building high-quality Android apps with tools like an emulator and mobile-specific libraries.
- **WebStorm**: A specialized IDE for **web development** with JavaScript, TypeScript, and related technologies.
- **Visual Studio**: A more robust, full-featured IDE from Microsoft, primarily used for large-scale, enterprise-level application development. It provides comprehensive tools for debugging, testing, and project management and supports over 30 languages.

## Command-Line Interface (CLI) 
You may think of software as having a graphical user interface, or **GUI**, which uses windows, icons, and menus. However, a significant portion of software, particularly in development, relies on **command-line interfaces** (CLIs) and **text-based user interfaces** (TUIs).

In this course, we will initially focus on CLI apps for several reasons:

- **Simplicity and Focus:** TUIs are straightforward to develop because they eliminate the complexities of graphical elements. By focusing solely on data input and output through text, we can concentrate on core programming concepts like **variables**, **decision structures**, and **loops** without the distraction of building a complex visual interface.
- **Foundation for Servers:** TUI programs often serve as the foundation for **server-side applications**. A server program's primary role is to process data and interact with other programs (like a website's GUI or a mobile app) rather than with a human user directly through a graphical interface. For example, a web server processes requests and sends back data without ever needing a window to display it.
- **Debugging:** The command line is an essential tool for developers. By learning to interact with our programs through a terminal, we become comfortable with a powerful environment for **testing and debugging** code. This skill is transferable to almost any programming context.

## Version Control and Collaboration
Git and GitHub are two essential tools in modern software development. **Git** is a **version control system** (VCS), while **GitHub** is a web-based service that hosts Git repositories. Think of Git as an engine that tracks changes, and GitHub as a social platform and cloud storage service built around that engine.

### Git
Git is a free, open-source, distributed version control system that developers install locally on their computers. Its primary purpose is to track and manage changes to files over time, especially source code. Git allows developers to:

- **Create a complete history** of their code, with "snapshots" called **commits**.
- **Revert to previous versions** if something goes wrong.
- **Work offline** because each developer has a full, local copy of the entire project's history.
- **Create branches** to work on new features or bug fixes in isolation without affecting the main codebase.
- **Merge changes** from different branches back into the main project.

The core of Git operates through a command-line interface, where developers use commands like `git clone`, `git commit`, `git push`, and `git pull`.

### GitHub
GitHub is a company that provides a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. It was founded in 2008 and acquired by Microsoft in 2018. GitHub takes the core functionality of Git and adds a rich ecosystem of tools for collaboration and project management.

Key features GitHub provides include:

- A **centralized, shared repository** in the cloud that serves as the "source of truth" for a project.
- A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** via a web-based interface that makes Git easier to use.
- **Collaboration tools** like **pull requests**, **code reviews**, **issue tracking**, and **project management boards**.
- **User management and security features**, such as two-factor authentication.

While you can use Git without GitHub, using a service like GitHub makes it much easier to collaborate on and share code with others, manage large projects, and back up your work. It is the world's largest host for source code and is widely used for both open-source and commercial projects.
