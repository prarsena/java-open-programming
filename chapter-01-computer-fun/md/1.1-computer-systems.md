# 1.1 Computer Systems
A computer system is comprised of hardware and software. 

- **Hardware** can also be called a machine, device, or computer. 
- **Software** can also be called a program, app, script, or tool. 

A computer system has an **operating system**, which is the most important software on the machine. 

## Examples of computer systems
Here are some examples of computer systems that you may interact with (along with operating systems):

## Hardware
The core hardware of a computer falls into four categories: **Processor**, **I/O**, **Memory**, and **Disk**. 

We can break the **I/O** (Input/Output) category into three sub-components: **Input Devices**, **Output Devices**, and **Networking Components**. 

The following table provides more information about these components:

| Category      | Component                     | Function                                                                                                                                          | Examples                                                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor** | Central Processing Unit (CPU) | The "brain" of the computer that directs and synchronizes all other components. It runs the operating system and applications, and manages tasks. | Intel Core i9, AMD Ryzen 9, Apple M4                                                |
| **I/O**       | Input Device                  | A device that sends data to the computer.                                                                                                         | Mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, microphone, webcam, scanner, Apple Pencil             |
| **I/O**       | Output Device                 | A device that presents data from the computer in an understandable format.                                                                        | Display screen, VR headset, printer, speakers, headphones                           |
| **I/O**       | Networking Components         | Manages connections and handles data between devices.                                                                                             | Network Interface Card (NIC), Wi-Fi chip, Bluetooth, cellular modem, USB-C ports    |
| **Memory**    | Random Access Memory (RAM)    | Volatile memory used to store data and instructions the CPU needs to access quickly. Data is erased when the power is off.                        | Crucial Pro 32GB DDR5, Kingston Fury 16GB, Apple Silicon Unified Memory 16GB        |
| **Disk**      | Storage Devices               | Non-volatile memory for long-term data storage. Data is retained even when the power is off.                                                      | Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), Solid State Drives (SSDs), USB flash drives, optical discs |

> Can you think of how the four components of hardware apply to computer systems listed in the previous section?

## Operating systems and software
The most important software running on a computer system is the **operating system (OS)**, which allows all other software to interact with the hardware. An OS is sometimes referred to as a **platform**. The operating system determines which apps can run on the computer system. 

Apps run on top of the operating system. You can run many apps at once in an operating system. Its job to determine which apps get precedence, and how to handle idle apps and background tasks. 

Common operating systems include: 

- Windows, macOS, and Linux for personal computers (laptops and desktops). 
- Android and iOS for mobile devices. 
- Linux and Windows for servers (non-personal computers). 
- Linux for embedded devices. 

**Some apps are OS-exclusive.** For example, iMessage and FaceTime only run on Apple operating systems like iOS for iPhone and macOS for MacBook. 

**All apps are OS-specific.** For example, you can't install the macOS version of Google Chrome or Spotify on Windows. Each operating systems requires its own installer, libraries and supported programming languages. 

At large or midsize software companies, development teams often focus on one operating system (or at least, a desktop team and a mobile team). In addition to the different user preferences, the underlying technologies of the operating systems differ. It takes time to become acquainted with the quirks of a particular platform. Each OS has its own libraries that determine certain elements of the app (for example, how to open and close it, what the menu bar or app settings window looks like). Additionally, each OS supports different programming languages. In fact, some OS **require** specific programming languages.

## 📲 Real World App Example: Spotify
Spotify is an example of a multi-platform application. You can download it on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and more. 

The same basic functionality is provided in every version: you log in, access your saved playlists, and play music. However, think about the differences between platforms. 

- *How do you open and close the app?*
- *What is displayed on home screen when you open the app?* 
- *How does the operating system indicate you are currently listening to music?*

Some of those differences are enforced by the operating system. For example, there is no button to close an app on mobile. Other differences are choices made by the application developer. A common **user experience** principle is to display fewer items on mobile than on desktop. 

Spotify determined that mobile users (including users listening on a watch) prefer less choice in song selection if it means they can access their favorite music immediately. Mobile users also tend to accept lower-quality data (i.e., worse song quality) if it means that their songs will load more quickly and their music won't stop if their internet connection drops for a few moments. 

## Computer memory 
Running programs are stored in a computer system's main memory component, RAM, which is measured in **gigabytes (GB)**. One gigabyte is **one billion bytes.** Modern smartphones generally range from 4GB in budget models to 16GB or more in high-end flagship phones. Laptops range from 8GB as a baseline up to to 128GB. With laptops, 16GB is widely considered the sweet spot for a smooth user experience. 

When you open a program, it requests a large block of memory from the OS. The OS determines the priority of the request. If insufficient space is available, it could close background apps to accommodate the new request. The OS uses **virtual memory mapping** to allocate dynamic and non-sequential memory blocks to the application. This is useful if the program needs more resources than it requested when it started. 

The benefit of Java and other high-level languages is that you don't have to manage this memory process. It happens automatically. 

As mentioned above, modern computer systems have multiple gigabytes of RAM. A laptop with 16GB of RAM has access to 16 billion bytes of memory.

Memory is stored as **bytes**, which consist of eight **bits**. Each bit is a binary digit, and it can have one of two possible values: a 0 or a 1. 

With a single byte, you can represent one of **256** different values (2<sup>8</sup>). A two-byte sequence can represent one of **65,536** different values (2<sup>16</sup>). This value could be:

- A number, such as an integer from **0 to 65,535**.
- A character, using a character encoding standard like **UTF-16**, where each character (or code unit) is represented by two or more bytes. For instance, the two-byte sequence `0x0041` represents the character 'A'.
- An instruction or address. A two-byte sequence could specify the location of the next instruction to execute or the position of data in memory.

Each byte is stored at a **memory address location**, a unique identifier for a location in a computer's memory (RAM). It's a numerical value, typically represented in hexadecimal format. For example, **`0x7FFC9F3E8B00`**.

## Software development
Computer software consists of code that uses logic to help a user perform at least one task. 

Software could be as simple as a script that takes a snapshot of the weather conditions every hour and writes it to a file. Or it could be as complex as Uber, which coordinates 36 million trips per day and supports multiple activities (taxi, food deliver, courier services, and even car rentals). 

However, in addition to being a computer program, Uber is also a company. A computer program doesn't need to be attached to a commercial enterprise. In fact, most computer programs have only one user: the person who programmed it. 

A person who writes computer programs a **software developer** (or developer). Other titles include programmer or engineer. 

The developer of a software application is often the only user because the software was built to solve a specific problem that the developer faced. Software should always solve a problem that you face. It doesn't matter how niche or insignificant the problem might seem to others, as long as you write software to solve a problem you face, learning to program will benefit you greatly. 

Software development is also a progressive skill. Start with lower-complexity projects to build your confidence. You'll soon realize just how capable you are. Then you'll start looking for bigger problems to solve. 

Software developers often share their programs for free on platforms like GitHub, enabling other developers to freely use and adjust the program to suit their needs. If you distribute your own software for free or improve the software of others, you are contributing to the **Open Source Community**. Of course, problem-solving skills are also desirable to employers, who often take special note of applicants who have built a diverse array of programs to solve problems of all sizes in personal and professional settings.
