# 4.1 The Increment and Decrement Operators

Before diving into loops, it is important to understand the shorthand operators used to add or subtract **one** from a variable.

The four ways to write these variable operations are:

| Operator | Description             |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| ++       | Increment variable by 1 |
| --       | Decrement variable by 1 |
| += 1     | Add 1 and assign        |
| -= 1     | Subtract 1 and assign   |
For example:

```java
int number = 5;
/* 
The following statements increment 
number by 1: 
*/
number = number + 1; 
number++; 
++number;
number += 1;

/* 
The following statements decrement
number by 1:
*/
number = number - 1;
number--;
--number;
number -= 1;
```

## Differences between Prefix and Postfix Notation
The increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators can be used in two modes: prefix (`++number`) or postfix (`number++`). While either can be used when the operator is the sole statement, they operate differently when used within a larger expression.

**Postfix notation (`number++`) is the most common form, especially within loops**.

*   **Prefix Notation (`++number`)**: The variable is incremented or decremented *prior* to the rest of the equation being evaluated. Use this when the updated value is needed immediately.
*   **Postfix Notation (`number++`)**: The variable is incremented or decremented *after* the rest of the equation has been evaluated. Use this when the original value is needed first.

**Example using Postfix Notation:**
```java
int x = 5;
int y = x++; 
// y is assigned 5 (original value), then x is incremented to 6
 
// x == 6 
// y == 5
```
**Example using Prefix Notation:**
```java
int x = 5;
int y = ++x; 
// x is incremented to 6, then y is assigned 6 (updated value)

// x == 6
// y == 6
```

#### Check Your Understanding (4.1)

1. Explain the primary difference in timing between the prefix and postfix increment operators when used in an expression.
2. What are the four ways to increment a variable `count` by 1?

#### Practice Problems (4.1)

1. **Operator Evaluation:** What are the final values of `a` and `b` after the following code executes?
```java
int a = 10;
int b = 5 + a--;
```

2. **Postfix Application:** Given `int x = 9;`, write a single Java statement using the postfix decrement operator that would set `y` to 9 and then set `x` to 8.
