In the previous chapter, we explored decision structures that allowed our programs to make choices and follow different execution paths. Now we extend our programming capabilities with **loops**, which enable programs to repeat code block execution, and **file I/O**, which allows programs to store and retrieve data persistently. These concepts are essential for creating programs that can process large amounts of data, validate user input, and maintain information between program runs.

### What you will learn
In this chapter, you will learn how to:

- Use **increment and decrement operators** (`++`, `--`) in prefix and postfix notation.
- Implement the three primary loop types: **`while`**, **`do-while`**, and **`for` loops**.
- Apply **advanced loop techniques** including running totals, input validation, and nested loops.
- Control loop execution with **`break` and `continue` statements**.
- Generate **random numbers** for simulations and games.
- Write data to files using **`PrintWriter`** and handle file exceptions properly.
- Read data from files using **`Scanner`** and **`File` objects**.
- Understand file paths and use **try-with-resources** for automatic resource management.
