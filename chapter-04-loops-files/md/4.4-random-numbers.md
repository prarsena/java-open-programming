# 4.4 Generating Random Numbers

Many applications, such as games or simulations, require the generation of randomly generated numbers. Java (via the Java API) provides the `Random` class for this purpose.

To use the `Random` class, you must include the import statement and create an instance of the class:

```java
import java.util.Random;

Random randomNumbers = new Random(); // Creating an instance
```

## Using the nextInt() and nextDouble() methods
The `nextInt()` method can be used to generate random integers. To generate a number within a specific range, bounds are specified.

To generate a random integer in a range starting from 0 up to (but not including) a specified bound:

```java
// Generates random int from 0 up to (but not including) 10
int randomNumber = randomNumbers.nextInt(10); 
```
To generate a random number within an arbitrary range (e.g., 1 through 6, simulating a game die):

```java
// Formula: 
// For 1 through 6: nextInt(6) + 1
int dieValue = randomNumbers.nextInt(6) + 1; // Range 1 to 6

// For 1 through 10: nextInt(10) + 1
```

There are several methods for generating random number types using an instance of Random:

```java
// Returns the next random number as a double.  
// The number will be within the range of 0.0 and 1.0.
randomNumbers.nextDouble();

// Returns the next random number as a float.  
// The number will be within the range of 0.0 and 1.0.
randomNumbers.nextFloat();

// Returns the next random number as an int.  
// The number will be within the range of an int, which is –2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,648.
randomNumbers.nextInt();

// This method accepts an integer argument, n.  
// It returns a random number as an int. 
// The number will be within the range of 0 to n-1.
randomNumbers.nextInt(int n);

// This method accepts two integer arguments, start and bound.  
// It returns a random number as an int within the range of start to boundary-1.
randomNumbers.nextInt(int start, int bound);
```

## Random Class vs. Math.random()
The `Random` class and the static `Math.random()` method differ in their features and control.

| Feature           | Random Class                                                         | Math.random() Method                               |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instantiation** | Instance-based (requires `new Random()`)                             | Static method (call without creating an instance)  |
| **Return Type**   | Provides methods for `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `float`, and `long` | Only generates a `double`                          |
| **Range**         | Customizable range and type                                          | Always between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive) |
| **Seeding**       | Allows setting a seed for reproducibility                            | No control over seed                               |

The following example shows the differences between `Math.random()` and the `Random` class:

```java
// Must import the Random class:
import java.util.Random;  
// The Random class can generate a random int or double:
Random r = new Random(); 
int randomInt = r.nextInt(100);  // Random int between 0 and 99
double randomDouble = r.nextDouble();  // Random double between 0.0 and 1.0


// Math.random() can only generate a double: 
double rMath = Math.random();  // Random double between 0.0 and 1.0
// You can multiply the value by 100 to turn it into an int. 
// there are many ways to represent this:
int rMathInt = (int) rMath * 100
rMathInt = Math.round(rMath*100));  
rMathInt = Integer.parseInt(String.format("%.0f", rMath*100));
```

In summary:

- **`Random` class**: Offers more flexibility, including generating random integers, floats, booleans, and long values, with an optional seed.
- **`Math.random()`**: A simpler way to generate a random `double` between `0.0` and `1.0` with no need for creating an instance but ßless control over the result.

For most purposes, if you need various types of random values, use the `Random` class. If you just need a quick random double, `Math.random()` is convenient.
