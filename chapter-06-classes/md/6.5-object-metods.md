# 6.5 Using Objects in Methods (Passing and Returning)

Custom objects can be passed as arguments to methods and returned from methods, forming complex relationships between classes.

## Passing Object References

When you pass an object as an argument to a method, Java follows the "pass by value" rule, but the value passed is a copy of the **memory address (reference)** to the object.

Because the receiving method gets a reference to the original object in memory, it can use the object's public mutator methods (setters) to modify the original object's internal state.

## Static Helper Methods and Object Parameters

A common pattern in executable classes is using **static helper methods** that accept custom objects as parameters. Since the method is static, it doesn't belong to any specific object, but it can operate on the object passed to it.

**Example 6.5: Passing a Song Object to a Playlist Manager**

Assume a static method exists in a manager class to add a song to a playlist's internal structure (for simplicity, we just print the action).

```java
public class MusicManager {
    // Static method accepts a Song object reference
    public static void printSongInfo(Song s) {
        // Accessing the instance methods (getters) of the passed object 's'
        System.out.println("Processing Song: " + s.getTitle() +
                           " by " + s.getArtist());
    }

    // Static method that modifies an object (requires setter)
    public static void markAsPlayed(Song s) {
        // Assume setPlayedStatus(true) is an instance method in Song
        s.setPlayedStatus(true);
        System.out.println(s.getTitle() + " status updated to Played.");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Song metal = new Song("Binary Code", "CPU", 4.0);

        // Pass the object reference
        printSongInfo(metal);

        // Pass the object reference for modification
        markAsPlayed(metal);
    }
}
```

_Note: This static helper method can work on **any** instance of the `Song` class._

## Returning Objects from Methods

Methods can return **references** to objects, including custom objects. The return type in the method header must match the class type being returned (e.g., `public static Car getLuxuryCar()`).

When an object reference is returned, the calling method receives the memory address and can assign it to a compatible reference variable.

#### Check Your Understanding (6.5)

1. When an object reference variable is passed to a method, what specific piece of information does the parameter variable hold?
2. Why is a static helper method that accepts a custom object as an argument an effective pattern in OOP?
3. If Method A calls Method B, and Method B has the header `public static String[] getArtists()`, what exactly is being returned?

#### Practice Problems (6.5)

1. **Object Access (Quiz Q267):** Assume you have a `User` class instance named `a`. Write the code snippet that correctly calls its instance method `getUsername()`.
2. **Method Header:** Write the method header for a static void method called `rechargeCar` that accepts one argument of type `Car`.
