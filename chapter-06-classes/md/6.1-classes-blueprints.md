# 6.1 Classes are Blueprints for Data

A **class** is a blueprint or template that defines the properties (**fields**) and behaviors (**methods**) that objects created from it will possess. 

We are familiar with Java Classes such as `Random`, `File`, `PrintWriter`, `Scanner`, and `String`, which we have used to create objects.

An **object** is a specific instance of a class, created in memory based on that blueprint. Here are some examples of how to create objects from classes: 

```java
// Create an instance of the Random class called randomNumber.
Random randomNumber = new Random();

// Create an instance of the File class called quotesFile.
// It takes one input parameter, a filename. 
File quotesFile = new File("quotes.txt");

// Create an instance of the Scanner class called kbd.
// It takes one input parameter, the System input (keyboard). 
Scanner kbd = new Scanner(System.in);

// Create an instance of the Scanner class called inputFile.
// It takes one input parameter, the File object called "quotesFile". 
Scanner inputFile = new Scanner(quotesFile);

// Create an instance of the String class called name.
// String is the only Java Class that doesn't require a constructor. 
// It takes one input parameter, a name.
String name = "Nancy";
```

A class specifies the **fields** and **methods** for a particular type of object. 

## Primitive Variables vs. Object Reference Variables

Variables in Java are categorized by what they store:

|Variable Type|Data Storage|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Primitive Variables**|Stores the **actual data value** directly in memory (e.g., `int`).|`int rating = 5;`|
|**Object Reference Variables**|Stores the **memory address** (reference) where the object's data is located.|`String name = "Zoe";`|

## Two Types of Classes

For practical development, we categorize classes based on their purpose:

1. **Object Classes (Model Classes):** These are the **blueprints** (e.g., `Car.java`, `Song.java`). They define the structure and behavior (fields and methods) of a custom object. They do not contain a `main` method.
2. **Executable Classes (Test Classes):** These contain the `public static void main(String[] args)` method. They serve as the program's starting point and are used to **instantiate** (create) and utilize objects defined by Object Classes.

To create an object from a class, we use the `new` keyword, which calls a constructor.

**Example: The Car Blueprint and the Test Drive**

We define a `Car` class and then create instances of it in a separate executable class.

```java
// Car.java (Object Class/Blueprint)
public class Car {
    // Fields (Data associated with this Car object)
    String make;
    String model;

    // Method (Behavior this Car object can perform)
    public void startEngine() {
        System.out.println(make + " " + model + " engine starting up.");
    }
}
```

```java
// TestCar.java (Executable Class)
public class TestCar {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Instantiate the first Car object
        Car sedan = new Car();

        // Access and set the object's fields directly (not recommended, see 6.2)
        sedan.make = "Honda";
        sedan.model = "Civic";

        System.out.println("Object 1 created: " + sedan.make);
        sedan.startEngine();

        // Instantiate a second, independent Car object
        Car truck = new Car();
        truck.make = "Ford";
        truck.model = "F-150";
        truck.startEngine();
    }
}
```

**Output:**

```bash
Object 1 created: Honda
Honda Civic engine starting up.
Ford F-150 engine starting up.
```

#### Check Your Understanding (6.1)

1. What is the key functional difference between an executable class and an object class?
2. Why is the variable `sedan` in `Car sedan = new Car();` considered a reference variable, and what does it store?
3. A class specifies the **fields** and **methods** for a particular type of object. What do these two terms refer to in practical programming?

#### Practice Problems (6.1)

1. **Conceptual Design (Music):** Imagine a class called `Playlist`. Name three data points (fields) a `Playlist` object should store and one action (method) it should be able to perform.
2. **Instantiation:** Write the single Java statement required to declare and instantiate a new object named `myCar` from the `Car` class (assuming no custom constructor exists).
