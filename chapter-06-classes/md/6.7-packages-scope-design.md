# 6.7 Packages, Scope, and Design

## Packages and the `import` Statement

Classes in the Java API are organized into collections called **packages**.

- **`java.lang` Package:** Contains fundamental classes like `String`, `System`, and `Math`. This package is **automatically imported** into every Java program.
- **Other Packages:** Require an explicit **`import` statement** to tell the compiler where to find the class. For example, `Scanner` is in `java.util`.

You can import a single class (e.g., `import java.util.Scanner;`) or use a **wildcard** (`*`) to import all classes in a package (e.g., `import java.util.*;`).

## Scope of Instance Fields

The **scope** of a local variable is limited to the method in which it is declared.

In contrast, **instance fields** (the private fields defined at the class level) have **class scope**—they are visible and accessible to **all** instance methods within that class. **Shadowing** occurs when a method parameter shares the same name as an instance field; the local parameter takes precedence.

## Object-Oriented Design (OOD)

OOD involves identifying necessary classes in a problem and assigning them **responsibilities**.

1. **Finding the Classes:** Look for **nouns** in the problem description (e.g., `Pet`, `Car`, `Song`).
2. **Identifying Responsibilities:** A class is responsible for two things:
    - **Knowing (Fields):** The data the object stores (e.g., a `Song` knows its `artist`).
    - **Doing (Methods):** The actions the object performs (e.g., a `Song` can `playSong()`).

#### Check Your Understanding (6.7)

1. If a program uses the `Random` class from `java.util`, why must it include an `import` statement, but a program using the `String` class does not?
2. How does the scope of an instance field differ from the scope of a parameter variable declared in a constructor?
3. In the context of OOD, define the two types of responsibilities a class should fulfill.

#### Practice Problems (6.7)

1. **Import Syntax:** Write the correct Java statement to import only the `File` class from the `java.io` package.
2. **Design Analysis:** For a fitness application, identify two nouns that should become classes and list one "knowing" and one "doing" responsibility for each.
