# 6.4 Constructors: Building and Initializing Objects

A **constructor** is a special type of instance method that is automatically called when an object is **instantiated** using the `new` keyword. Its primary role is to initialize the object’s fields.

## Constructor Properties

Constructors have unique characteristics that separate them from standard methods:

1. **Naming:** Must have the exact same name as the class (e.g., `public Car(...)`).
2. **Return Type:** They have **no return type** (not even `void`).
3. **Behavior:** They may not return any values.
4. **Access:** They are typically declared as `public`.

## The Default Constructor

If you **do not** write any constructor for your class, Java automatically provides a **default constructor** (a no-argument, or no-arg, constructor). This constructor initializes instance fields to their default values:

- Numeric types (int, double) are 0 or 0.0.
- Boolean types are `false`.
- Reference types (String, custom objects) are `null`.

**Example: Default Initialization**

If a `Student` class has no custom constructors and fields `String name`, `double gpa`, and `boolean enrolled`, when instantiated with `Student s = new Student();`, the fields will be initialized to `name: null`, `gpa: 0.0`, and `enrolled: false`.

## Writing Your Own Constructors and Constructor Overloading

If you define **any** custom constructor (e.g., one that takes arguments), **Java no longer provides the default no-arg constructor**. If you still need a no-arg option, you must explicitly write it.

**Overloading** allows a class to have multiple constructors (or methods) with the same name, provided they have **different parameter lists (signatures)**. This provides flexible ways to instantiate objects.

**Example 6.4b: Overloaded Song Constructors (Music)**

A `Song` object needs to be initialized either with full details or as a simple placeholder.

```java
public class Song {
    private String title;
    private String artist;
    private double durationMinutes;

    // 1. No-Arg Constructor (Must be manually written to retain default instantiation)
    public Song() {
        this.title = "Untitled Track";
        this.artist = "Various Artists";
        this.durationMinutes = 0.0;
    }

    // 2. Parameterized Constructor (Requires title and artist)
    public Song(String title, String artist) {
        this.title = title;
        this.artist = artist;
        this.durationMinutes = 3.5; // Default duration
    }

    // 3. Fully Parameterized Constructor (Requires all three fields)
    public Song(String title, String artist, double durationMinutes) {
        // Use 'this' to refer to the object's instance fields
        this.title = title;
        this.artist = artist;
        this.durationMinutes = durationMinutes;
    }
}
// Instantiation examples:
// Song placeholder = new Song();                             // Calls #1
// Song duet = new Song("Perfect Symphony", "Ed Sheeran");     // Calls #2
// Song classic = new Song("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", 5.9); // Calls #3
```

The compiler uses the **method signature** (name + parameter types/order) to match the call with the correct overloaded constructor.

#### Check Your Understanding (6.4)

1. Name two key properties that distinguish a constructor from a standard method.
2. If you write a two-argument constructor for the `Pet` class, why would `Pet myPet = new Pet();` generate a compiler error?
3. What is constructor overloading, and what constraint must all overloaded constructors satisfy?

#### Practice Problems (6.4)

1. **Default Value (Quiz Q29):** What is the default value of a `String` field in a Java class if no constructor initializes it?
2. **Constructor Writing (Car):** Write the header for a constructor in the `Car` class that accepts only a `String` representing the car's color.
3. **Overloading Necessity:** A `Pet` class needs a constructor that accepts a `String` name, and a second constructor that accepts a `String` name and a `double` weight. Write the signatures for these two constructors.
