# 6.3 Static vs. Instance: Class-Level vs. Object-Level

In Chapter 5, we were introduced to **static** methods. Now that we are writing custom classes, understanding the distinction between static and instance members is critical.

The core difference lies in their **ownership** and **context**:

|Feature|**Instance Members (Non-Static)**|**Static Members (Class Members)**|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Ownership**|Belongs to a specific **object** (instance) created via `new`.|Belongs to the **class itself**.|
|**Access/Call**|Must be called on an **object reference** (e.g., `myCar.startEngine()`).|Called directly on the **class name** (e.g., `Math.random()`).|
|**Context**|Operates on the object's specific, unique data (instance fields).|Cannot access instance fields or methods of the class, as there is no specific object context.|
|**`this` keyword**|Available, refers to the current object executing the method.|Prohibited, as there is no instance object to refer to.|

Methods that operate on an object's specific private fields (like getters and setters) are always **instance methods**.

**Example 6.3: Tracking Total Cars Built (Static Field)**

If we wanted to track the total number of `Car` objects ever created, this count should be shared among _all_ instances, making it a **static field** belonging to the class itself.

```java
public class Car {
    // Instance fields (unique to each object)
    private String make;

    // Static field (shared by all Car objects)
    private static int totalCarsBuilt = 0;

    // Constructor (omitted for brevity)

    // Static method (operates on the static field)
    public static int getTotalCarsBuilt() {
        return totalCarsBuilt;
    }

    // Instance method (operates on the instance field)
    public String getMake() {
        return this.make; // Uses 'this' reference
    }

    // Instance method
    public void buildCar() {
        // Instance method can update the static field
        totalCarsBuilt++;
        System.out.println("Car built. Total: " + totalCarsBuilt);
    }
}
// In TestCar:
// Car.getTotalCarsBuilt(); // Called on Class (static)
// Car mySedan = new Car();
// mySedan.buildCar(); // Called on Object (instance)
```

#### Check Your Understanding (6.3)

1. What modifier must be used if a method is intended to belong to the class rather than any specific object instance?
2. Why is the `this` keyword illegal to use inside a static method?
3. If you have a `Pet` object named `myDog`, write the syntax to call an instance method named `bark()` and the syntax to call a static method named `getSpeciesCount()` located in the `Pet` class?

#### Practice Problems (6.3)

1. **Design Principle:** Should the method `getHungerLevel()` (from Section 6.2, which accesses a private instance field) be declared as `static` or non-static (instance)? Explain why.
2. **Music Example:** If a `Song` class contains a `static` field storing the name of the record label that owns all songs, how would another class access this record label name?
